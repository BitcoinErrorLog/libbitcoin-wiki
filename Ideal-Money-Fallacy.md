It has been [proposed](http://sites.stat.psu.edu/~gjb6/nash/money.pdf) that the existence of an international non-political (i.e. objective) "value index" will result in [people](Glossary#person) compelling [states](Glossary#state) to "value target" their monies against the index. It has also been suggested that Bitcoin is such an index and as such will precipitate this scenario.

The leverage available to people is the option to leave certain state monies for others. The [capital flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight) is from monies of higher [price inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) to lower, based on comparison with the index. The consequence of flight is that states must increasingly target their individual rates of price inflation to the index. This result in the state monies "asymptotically" approaching the state of [Ideal Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_money) represented by the index.

Ideal Money is state money ([fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money)) with a zero rate of price inflation:

> ...there is no ideal rate of inflation that should be selected and chosen as the target but rather that the ideal concept would necessarily be that of a zero rate for what is called inflation.
