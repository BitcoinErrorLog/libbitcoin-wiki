The need to [exchange](Glossary#exchange) from one [coin](Glossary#coin) in order to [trade](Glossary#trade) with [merchants](Glossary#merchant) of another is a cost. This cost must be non-zero even if automated, as it must consume space and/or time. As such one coin is always "better" (higher [utility](Glossary#utility)) than two.

We can reasonably assume that two distinct moneys cannot perpetually have identical utility. [Thier's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law#Reverse_of_Gresham.27s_Law_.28Thiers.27_Law.29) discusses the consequences of better money in the absence of [state](Glossary#state) controls. From this we necessarily conclude that the better of the two monies will eventually replace the other, and that this will be the case for all coins in the absence of state controls.

This does not imply that new coins cannot be created or exist over a significant amount of time. It implies that there is a [market](Glossary#market) pressure toward a single coin.
