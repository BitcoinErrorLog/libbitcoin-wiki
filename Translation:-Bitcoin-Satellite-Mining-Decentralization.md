Translated from [the original Japanese article](http://doublehash.me/bitcoin-satellite-mining-decentralization) using [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com).

Today, the Blockstream Bitcoin satellites have taken up the topic of the community. I was surprised at the huge scale project suddenly announced.

Briefly, it is a project to cover the entire Earth with multiple satellites and deliver Bitcoin blocks and transactions in real-time everywhere.

What is amazing is that this is not a concept, and the satellite is already in operation. It covers 2/3 of the Earth and can receive blockchains. Various applications can be imagined because it is enough to prepare facilities of receiver of about 100 dollars to receive blockchains.

By the way, although this Bitcoin Satellite is commented that people in developing countries that can use it anywhere in the world can access bitcoins, I am reading another big intention.

It is a blow to mining centralization.

I interviewed Mr. Samson Mow, Blockstream's CSO, on this kind of view.

**Oishi:** There used to be a secret strategy to promote non-centralization of mining when I had a meal before, but I told you it is still a secret. Maybe, is this satellite the "secretive"?

**Samson Mow:** Actually, that's right. However, it is still 100% complete. Currently only downloads, but there is a possibility that the mining really changes when uploading parts become available with low latency. Since it is not necessary to connect to the transmission line, mining is possible in places where electric power can be obtained anywhere in the world.

Oishi: That is amazing. For example, what can be done?

**Samson Mow:** For example, you can make solar mining by standing the panel in the middle of the desert. Place the panel on the ground and place the mining equipment in the ground. And you can connect to a Bitcoin network.

**Oishi:** It's super cool.

Currently mining has been conducted only in some areas, mainly China, from conditions such as electricity costs and climate. I think that there are other places suitable for mining on the Earth, but there is a possibility that it could not be installed due to connection equipment etc.

I think that there is great significance in terms of decentralization if it is possible to mining in the land such as desert and extreme North by using solar power, natural energy such as geothermal and hydraulic power. Bitcoin Satellite aims to diversify mining, the magnificent vision is already moving as a feasible technology. Interesting.
