It follows from the [risk sharing principle](Risk-Sharing-Principle) that system security depends upon covert [mining](Glossary#mine) and [trade](Glossary#trade). A [coin](Glossary#coin) exists as a [mutually-beneficial](Balance-of-Power-Fallacy) [market](Glossary#market) between [miners](Glossary#miner) and [merchants](Glossary#merchant) for the [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) of [transactions](Glossary#transaction) within [blocks](Glossary#block).

The necessarily covert activities are listed by role:

**Miner**
1. obtain blocks [to build upon]
2. obtain transactions [to earn fees from]
3. create and distribute blocks [to cause others to build upon]
4. receive payment for confirmations [to finance operations]

**Merchant**
1. obtain blocks [to validate customer payment]
2. obtain transactions (optional) [to anticipate customer payment]
3. create and distribute transactions [to obtain customer payment]
4. make payment for confirmations [to compensate confirmation]
