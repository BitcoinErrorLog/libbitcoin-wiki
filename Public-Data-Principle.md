It follows from the [risk sharing principle](Risk-Sharing-Principle) that system security depends upon covert [mining](Glossary#mine) and [trade](Glossary#trade). As detailed in [Balance of Power Fallacy](Balance-of-Power-Fallacy) a [coin](Glossary#coin) exists as a [market](Glossary#market) between [miners](Glossary#miner) and [merchants](Glossary#merchant) for [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) of [transactions](Glossary#transaction).

The necessarily covert activities are listed by role:

Miner
* obtain blocks [to build upon]
* obtain transactions [to earn fees from]
* create and distribute blocks [to cause others to build upon]
* receive payment for confirmations [to finance operations]

Merchant
* obtain blocks [to validate customer payment]
* obtain transactions (optional) [to anticipate customer payment]
* create and distribute transactions [to obtain customer payment]
* make payment for confirmations [to compensate confirmation]
