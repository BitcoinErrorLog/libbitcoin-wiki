There is a theory that [pooling](Glossary#pooling) and [centralization](Glossary#centralization) do not materially reduce the security afforded by [risk sharing](Risk-Sharing-Principle) because [miners](Glossary#miner) and the [economy](Glossary#economy) will disperse as necessary, similar to the scattering cockroaches disturbed by a light. This is essentially a dismissal of the [Threat Level Paradox](Threat-Level-Paradox).

[People](Glossary#person) cannot be expected to work against their own financial interest. In order for risk sharing to increase the financial pressures against it must be reversed. An assumption to the contrary is economically irrational. Reversal cost can be significant, especially considering [consensus](Glossary#consensus)-based [pooling pressures](Pooling-Pressure-Risk) and [decentralization](Centralization-Risk) switching costs.

The theory is based on [grinders](Glossary#grinder) switching [miner](Glossary#miner) allegiance at low cost. This is based on the [Balance of Power Fallacy](Balance-of-Power-Fallacy), which incorrectly models miners as the threat. A shift of [hash power](Glossary#hash_power) from one mine to another does not reduce pooling or the risk associated with it.

A reduction in pooling requires an increase in the number of miners. This requires that grinders, converted to miners, suffer the increased cost associated with reduced pooling. Given that such a conversion takes time and may not be in the financial interest of [grinders](Glossary#grinder) it is an error to discount the [economic](Glossary#economic) impact.
