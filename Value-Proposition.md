The [value](Glossary#value) of Bitcoin over its alternatives derives directly from removing the [state](Glossary#state) from control over both [monetary supply](Glossary#subsidy) and [transaction](Glossary#transaction) [censorship](Glossary#censorship). Advantages include freedom from [seigniorage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage), [foreign exchange controls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls), and [financial surveillance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer). These allow the money to be [transferred](Glossary#transfer) to any [person](Glossary#person), in any place, at any time, without need for third party permission.

It would be an error to assume these advantages flow from the existence of a more efficient technology than employed by state monies. The technology is [far less efficient](Scalability-Property), yet it helps people [resist state controls](Risk-Sharing-Principle). Is is this [resistance](Axiom-of-Resistance) that provides the value.

These advantages represent cost reduction through the avoidance of tax. Seigniorage is directly a tax, while foreign exchange controls limit its evasion. Financial surveillance limits tax evasion more generally. While Bitcoin cannot eliminate tax, or even necessarily reduce total takings, it represents a change the nature of taxation. In any case, for those who consider the state a social good, the option to voluntarily fund it remains.
