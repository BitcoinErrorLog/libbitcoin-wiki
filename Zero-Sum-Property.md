Bitcoin [mining](Glossary#mine) is a [zero sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game). When On average the [chain](Glossary#chain) grows by one [block](Glossary#block) every 10 minutes, with the full [reward](Glossary#reward) controlled by its [miner](Glossary#miner). Miners compete to achieve this reward and will, apart from [pooling pressures](Pooling-Pressure-Risk), each average a number of rewards proportional to [hash power](Glossary#hash-power). The difference between a miner's cost and this reward over time is the [rate of return](Glossary#interest) on capital [invested](Glossary#lend) in the mine.

There are two aspects of the zero sum property:

* For the time period between [organizations](Glossary#organization) one miner earns a reward and all other miners earn no reward. Neither price, hash rate, difficulty, inflation, fees, nor anything else has any effect on this property.

* The magnitude of rewards, in either [coin](Glossary#coin) [units](Glossary#unit) or [exchange](Glossary#exchange) [price](Glossary#price), has no effect on the rate of return on capital.

*Idealized* Bitcoin mining is a [closed system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_system). Return on capital does vary *relative to other mines*, due to the [proximity premium](Proximity-Premium-Flaw) and [variance discount](Variance-Discount-Flaw) protocol flaws, as well as [economies of scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale) and operator efficiency. Yet because these only impact the relative cost of hash power, it is the *proportionality* of return rates is affected.

But *actual* Bitcoin is not a closed system. The [market](Glossary#market) and anti-market pooling pressures of [variation](Glossary#variation) and [distortion](Glossary#distortion) (respectively) are external. Fundamentally Bitcoin exists to defend markets, necessarily pitting distortion against variation (or lack thereof).
