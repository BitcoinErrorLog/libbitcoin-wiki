Bitcoin [mining](Glossary#mine) is a [zero sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game). On average the [chain](Glossary#chain) grows by one [block](Glossary#block) every 10 minutes, with the full [reward](Glossary#reward) controlled by its [miner](Glossary#miner). Miners compete to achieve this reward and, apart from [pooling pressures](Pooling-Pressure-Risk), will each on average achieve a number of rewards proportional to [hash power](Glossary#hash-power). The difference between a miner's costs and this reward over time is the [rate of return](Glossary#interest) on capital [invested](Glossary#lend) in the mine.

There are two aspects of the zero sum property:

* During the time period between [organizations](Glossary#organization) one miner earns a reward and all other miners earn no reward. Neither price, hash rate, difficulty, inflation, fees, nor anything else has any effect on this property.

* The magnitude of rewards, in either [coin](Glossary#coin) [units](Glossary#unit) or [exchange](Glossary#exchange) [price](Glossary#price), has no effect on the rate of return on capital.

However, return on capital does vary *relative to other mines* due to [pooling](Glossary#pooling).
