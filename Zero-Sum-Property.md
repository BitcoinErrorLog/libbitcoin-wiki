Bitcoin [mining](Glossary#mine) is a [zero sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game). On average the [chain](Glossary#chain) grows by one [block](Glossary#block) every 10 minutes, with all [reward](Glossary#reward) controlled by its [miner](Glossary#miner). Miners compete to achieve this reward and, apart from [pooling pressures](Pooling-Pressure), will each, on average, achieve a number of rewards proportional to [hash power](Glossary#hash-power). The difference between a miner's costs and this reward over time is the return on capital invested in the mine.
