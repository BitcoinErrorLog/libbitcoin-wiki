Labor and leisure are complementary [human actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_axiom) that pertain [production and consumption](Production-and-Consumption) of [economic goods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services). Labor is the process of consumption to produce an economic good (production). Leisure is the process of consumption that does not produce an economic good. Consumption without [utility](Glossary#utility) is the process of [waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste). These actions should not be conflated with goods.

This subtle error implies that both labor and leisure are economic goods. Yet goods neither create nor consume goods, these are human actions that occur through time and space. Correctly stated, both labor and leisure are processes that consume one's time, an economic good.

> In each hour he will expend his effort [time] toward producing that good whose marginal product is highest on his value scale. If he must give up an hour of labor [time], he will give up a unit of that good whose marginal utility is lowest on his value scale. At each point he will balance the utility of the product on his value scale against the disutility of further work [time]. We know that a man's marginal utility of goods provided by effort [time] will decline as his expenditure of effort [time] increases. On the other hand, with each new expenditure of effort [time], the marginal disutility of the effort [time] continues to increase. Therefore, a man will expend his labor [time] as long as the marginal utility of the return exceeds the marginal disutility of the labor effort [time]. A man will stop work [time] when the marginal disutility of labor [time] is greater than the marginal utility of the increased goods provided by the effort [time].

> Then, as his consumption of leisure [time] increases, the marginal utility of leisure [time] will decline, while the marginal utility of the goods forgone increases, until finally the utility of the marginal products forgone becomes greater than the marginal utility of leisure [time], and the actor will resume labor [time] again.

It is neither correct nor necessary to assume leisure is a good, and by doing so imply that labor is an anti-good. By properly accounting for consumption of a person's time, "leisure preference" derives directly from the law of [marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility). As the above derivation shows, this is the result of the necessary [trade](Glossary#trade) of time expended on one for time expended on the other.

Time, space and goods are the *factors* of all production, while labor is the *process* of production. **Labor and production are distinct names for the same human action.** The act of producing is labor; the act of laboring is production. The [pure bank](Pure-Bank) provides the model of all production. This cycle is clearly evident in the case of self-employment, which is just the example of [production](Production-and-Consumption). In the case of a wage-earner there are two producers, the employee and the employer.

A pure wage-earning employee obtains *borrowed* capital and thereby trades for food, education, and equipment, as required for a job. This *reserved* capital (including his body), depreciates on the job, and as a consequence of it. The value of his time and depreciated capital - the work product, is *loaned* to the employer as it develops. The employer repays the employee with *interest* for the time of this loan - at the wage rate. The amount of principal and interest less depreciation of the employee's reserve is *returned* to the employee's creditor. In the case where his capital investment is borrowed from his own hoard, the employee is his own creditor. The return is then consumed or reinvested in future labor (or otherwise).

A real employer and employee each obtain a [market](Glossary#market) rate of [interest](Glossary#interest). The employee's interest rate is expressed in his wage rate. The employer's interest rate is the [price](Glossary#price) obtained for the work product over the time of its production. The employer's production expense is the consumption of his borrowed capital, [reserved](Reservation-Principle) over that time, just as for the employee. The amount by which interest exceeds depreciation is the [increase in wealth](Depreciation-Principle) to both parties.

The employee trades leisure for labor to the extent that he values the amount of interest above the value he attributes to leisure. Leisure preference is a restatement of [time preference](Time-Preference-Fallacy), where the value of one's own time is the economic good being traded.
