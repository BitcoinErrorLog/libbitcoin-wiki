**Economic Security**

In [Social Network Principle](Social-Network-Principle) it is shown that Bitcoin is a network of [human](Glossary#person) relationships. This can be modeled as a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Directed_graph) where each vertex represents a [merchant](Glossary#merchant) and each edge represents a [trade](Glossary#trade) for bitcoin. Edges indicate the direction of movement of [coin](Glossary#coin) and are quantified in the number of [units](Glossary#unit) traded. All [owners](Glossary#owner) are presumed to have been merchants at the time of coin receipt, including as [miners](Glossary#miner) (selling [confirmations](Glossary#confirmation)) and as recipients of charity (selling [goodwill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwill_(accounting))).

If a person is not personally accepting coin, or does not personally [validate](Glossary#validation) coin accepted, the person cannot reject invalid coin. The person is entrusting this task to a [central](Glossary#centralization) authority. Similarly, when a person [delegates](Glossary#delegation) coin to another party, the person no longer owns the coin. In both cases the person controls only a promise to trade back the coin and therefore does not [contribute to security](Risk-Sharing-Principle). All people utilizing the same delegate are reduced to just one vertex that represents the delegate.

For any period of time, [economic](Glossary#economy) security is a function of the number of merchants and the similarity of amounts traded. The strongest economy would be all people in the world trading for the same number of units in the period, an ideal which can be called a "distributed" economy. The weakest would be one delegate accepting all units traded in the period, which would be a "centralized" economy.

**Confirmation Security**

Similar to economic security, [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) security can be modeled as an [edgeless graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_graph). Each [miner](Glossary#miner) is represented by one vertex on the graph. A [grinder](Glossary#grinder) is not a miner as the grinder has no decision-making ability, only the operator is represented. The total [hash power](Glossary#hash-power) employed by a miner is the weight (value) of the vertex. The strongest censorship resistance is every person in the world mining with equal hash power.

As shown in [Balance of Power Fallacy](Balance-of-Power-Fallacy), the systemic mining [threat](Glossary#state) is motivated by [censorship](Glossary#censorship), not [double-spending](Glossary#double-spend). Total [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate) provides security against such attacks, but [pooling](Glossary#pooling) of hash rate works against it. As mining collects into pools it becomes cheaper to [co-opt](Glossary#co-option) than to compete against it.

For any period of time, the decentralization of Bitcoin mining is a function of the number of miners and the similarity of hash power they directed, an ideal which can be called "distributed" confirmation. The weakest would be one miner with 100% of hash power, which would be "centralized" confirmation.

**todo**

The graphs represent activity occurring in any window of time. While people could decide to withdraw from delegates and/or [pools](Glossary#pooling) at some point in time, and validate their own [transactions](Glossary#transaction), they cannot act in defense until after they actually do so. The distinction is analogous to being armed vs. having the ability to become armed. As shown in [Cockroach Fallacy](Cockroach-Fallacy), the latter matters not when you are getting robbed.
