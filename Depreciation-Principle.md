Ownership of a product moves from producer to consumer (or producer), yet neither production nor consumption occurs at that time. The producer hoards the product before the [trade](Glossary#trade) and the consumer hoards it after. The product exits and is eventually traded between two [people](Glossary#person). The terms "producer" and "consumer" are names for the *objectives* ([production and leisure](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/p/926)) of the two primary economic actors. The producer *intends* to create (appreciate) capital, while the consumer intends to destroy (depreciate) it. But the producer's hoard (inventory) depreciates the product just as does the consumer's.

The [common use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_(economics)) of the term "consumption" conflates [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest#Economics) and [depreciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation_(economics)). The fact of a product *sale* represents [investor](Glossary#lend) interest, not depreciation. The *depreciation* of a product is actual consumption, and represents the extraction of [service to its owner](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/p/974) ([utility](Glossary#utility)). A producer who only [owns](Glossary#own) does not produce and a consumer who does not own does not consume. Only depreciation reflects actual consumption just as only creation reflects actual production. The net proceeds a sale from producer to consumer is interest, even if is [capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure) through reinvestment. Only *action* is relevant to the economic meaning of consumption, not the name of a given role.

Wealth, defined as capital accumulation, is the sum of products. All products are hoarded and depreciating. Production creates products, where interest is both the cost and return on doing so. The price of a product is the sum of its interest return on investment and the cost of all products consumed in its production. Any product incorporated as a component of the final product is fully depreciated as an independent product and appreciated in the new product. Given that costs equate to [investment principal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)#Principal), the net increase in products is simply interest. Capital accumulation therefore implies a rate of interest greater than depreciation. Notice that the absolute amount of capital (i.e. product [value](Glossary#value)) is not relevant to these ratios. 

```
growth-rate = wealth-today / wealth-yesterday
growth-rate = interest-rate / depreciation-rate
wealth-today = wealth-yesterday * (interest-rate / depreciation-rate)
```

The following examples demonstrate the effect of depreciation on economic growth.

```
growth-rate = interest-rate / depreciation-rate
3.0% = 9% / 6%
.75% = 9% / 12%
```

If sale and full depreciation of products occurs immediately after production, the products have no [durability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_good), or an infinite rate of depreciation. While production still earns interest, there is full economic contraction (no wealth). On the other hand, if products exhibit no depreciation, economic growth is infinite (unlimited wealth).

```
growth-rate = interest-rate / depreciation-rate
0% = 9% / ∞%
∞% = 9% / 0%
```
