Ownership of a product moves from producer to consumer (or producer), yet neither production nor consumption occurs at that time. The producer hoards the product before the [trade](Glossary#trade) and the consumer hoards it after. The product exits and is eventually traded between two [people](Glossary#person). The terms "producer" and "consumer" are names for the *objectives* ([production and leisure](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/p/926)) of the two primary economic actors. The producer *intends* to create (appreciate) capital, while the consumer intends to destroy (depreciate) it. But the producer's hoard (inventory) depreciates the product just as does the consumer's.

The [common use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_(economics)) of the term "consumption" conflates [interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest#Economics) and [depreciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation_(economics)). The fact of a product *sale* represents [investor](Glossary#lend) interest, not depreciation. The *depreciation* of a product is actual consumption, and represents the extraction of [service to its owner](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/p/974) ([utility](Glossary#utility)). A producer who only owns does not produce and a consumer who does not own does not consume. Only depreciation reflects actual consumption just as only creation reflects actual production. The net proceeds a sale from producer to consumer is interest, even if is [capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure) through reinvestment. Only *action* is relevant to the economic meaning of consumption, not the name of a given role.
