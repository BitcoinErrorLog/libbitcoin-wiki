[Value](Gloassary#value) is [are subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) and therefore [price](Gloassary#price) stability is an economic fiction. The [exchange](Glossary#exchange) [price](Glossary#price) of a money is is determined by its [supply and demand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) which is in turn affected by the supply and demand schedules of all people for all products.

We can organize monies into three supply categories:

* Rational supply (commodity, stable)
* Arbitrary supply (fiat, unstable)
* Fixed supply (bitcoin, stable)

Commodity money supply increases due to the financial incentive to [produce more](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining) when price is expected to be at or above production cost (inclusive of capital cost). This relationship between price and supply is predictable despite price (and therefore supply) not being so. Because price is not predictable this [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation) cannot be [capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value). Therefore all holders of the money suffer a reduction in value from the increased supply. Competition ensures that this production financed by existing holders is limited to the [capital cost](Glossary#interest). Destruction of the commodity decreases supply and therefore increases value. The feedback of value decrease resulting from supply increase reduces production incentive, creating stability.

Fiat money supply is increased arbitrarily by the [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) due to the financial reward of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) and decreases due to destruction. When this monetary inflation is predictable it can be capitalized, which discounts the return on seigniorage. As such changes to supply are often [not published](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/crisis-hit-venezuela-halts-publication-of-another-major-indicator-idUSKBN16S1YF). Due to [state monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_monopoly) protection (i.e. production is the crime of couterfeit), competition cannot effectively limit returns to capital cost. The resulting sovereign [profit](Glossary#profit) (tax) is the reward of seigniorage and the [reason for fiat](Reservation-Principle). Monopoly protection is the sole economic distinction between commodity and fiat money. The positive reward of seigniorage is mitigated only by political unrest, making fiat the cause of unrest and therefore instability.

Bitcoin supply is independent of price. Destruction of monetary units decreases supply and therefore increases value. Given that [subsidy](Glossary#subsidy) is predictable it is capitalized and has [no affect on price](Inflation-Fallacy) over time. Its purpose is to rationally distribute [units](Glossary#units) and so is eventually phased out. As [fees](Glossary#fee) necessarily rise with demand the [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Property) mitigates demand directly. Stability results from limiting [utility](Glossary#utility) as opposed to increasing supply. This is a [scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability) limit that cannot be eliminated.
