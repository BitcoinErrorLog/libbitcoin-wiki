[Value](Glossary#value) is [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) and therefore [price stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability) is an economic fiction. The [exchange](Glossary#exchange) price of a money is is determined by its [supply and demand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) which is in turn affected by the demand schedules of all people for all products. The stability of a money is not a tendency toward constant [prices](Glossary#price) in all other things, it is a [damping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio) relationship between demand for the money and its supply.

We can organize monies into three supply categories:

* Rational supply ([commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity))
* Arbitrary supply ([fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money))
* Fixed supply ([bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin))

In any money, destruction of [units](Glossary#unit) decreases supply and therefore increases value to those that remain. Given that there is no financial incentive for loss it does not impact stability.

Commodity money supply increases due to the financial incentive to [produce more](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining) when price is expected to be at or above production cost (inclusive of capital cost). This relationship between price and supply is predictable despite price (and therefore supply) not being so. Because price is not predictable this [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation) cannot be [capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value). Therefore all holders of the money suffer a reduction in value from the increased supply. Competition ensures that this production financed by existing holders is limited to the [capital cost](Glossary#interest). The feedback of value decrease resulting from supply increase reduces production incentive, creating stability.

Fiat money supply is increased arbitrarily (or taxed as [demurrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency))) by the [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) due to the financial reward of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage). When this monetary inflation is predictable it can be capitalized, which discounts the return on seigniorage. As such changes to supply are often [not published](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/crisis-hit-venezuela-halts-publication-of-another-major-indicator-idUSKBN16S1YF). Due to [state monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_monopoly) protection (i.e. production is the crime of counterfeit), competition cannot effectively limit returns to capital cost. The resulting sovereign [profit](Glossary#profit) (tax) is the reward of seigniorage and the [reason for fiat](Reservation-Principle). Monopoly protection is the sole economic distinction between commodity and fiat money. The supply increase caused by seigniorage is mitigated only by political unrest as [people](Glossary#person) resist the consequential value decrease. This unrest initially manifests as [capital flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight), which is countered by [foreign exchange controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls).

Bitcoin supply is independent of price. Given that [subsidy](Glossary#subsidy) is predictable it is capitalized and has [no affect on price](Inflation-Fallacy) over time. Its purpose is to rationally distribute units and so is eventually phased out. As [fees](Glossary#fee) necessarily rise with demand the [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Property) mitigates demand. **Stability results from limiting demand directly as opposed to relying on an increase in supply to do so.** This is in turn an economic pressure that precludes [linear scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability).

This raises the question of whether [sufficient demand](Threat-Level-Paradox) can exist to secure Bitcoin. Aggregate demand [can be increased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) through the use of off-[chain](Glossary#chain) [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation), for below-threshold scenarios, [settled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(finance)) on chain. Yet this cost-security compromise produces its own limit. In other words Bitcoin stability is a consequence of inherent non-scalability. This does not imply any specific price level, but that the price level is not unbounded.
