There is a theory that in a choice to join a ban on Bitcoin, individual states face a prisoner's dilemma. A meaningful ban implies one or more states (the "prison") will enforce [economic sanctions](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-are-economic-sanctions) (at least) on defecting states (the "prisoners").

The rewards for defection are:
* A [reserve currency]() not taxed via seigniorage.
* Ability to transact in the reserve privately.

The punishments for defection are:
* Economic sanction.
