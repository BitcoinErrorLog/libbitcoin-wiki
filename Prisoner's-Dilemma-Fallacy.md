There is a theory that in a choice to join a ban on Bitcoin, individual states face a [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). A meaningful ban implies one or more states (the "prison") will enforce [economic sanctions](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-are-economic-sanctions) (at least) on other states (the "prisoners") potentially moving to Bitcoin as a [reserve currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency).

We assume that the prisoners who may decide to use Bitcoin are trading partners. In other words the use of Bitcoin as a reserve currency is useful in that they have a partner to transact with.

The outcome for individual Bitcoin (**S**ucker):
* Economic sanction.
* An unusable reserve currency (no trading partners).

The outcome for group Bitcoin (**R**eward):
* Economic sanction.
* Trading partner economic sanction.
* A reserve currency not taxed via seigniorage.

The outcome for individual Dollar (**T**emptation):
* Inclusion in the global financial system.
* A reserve currency taxed via seigniorage.

The outcome for group Dollar (**P**unishment):
* Inclusion in the global financial system.
* A reserve currency taxed via seigniorage.

#### Payoff Matrix
|Brazil\Ireland     |Bitcoin|Dollar  |
|-------------------|-------|--------|
|Bitcoin            |R\R    |S\T     |
|Dollar             |T\S    |P\P     |

`T > R > P > S` must be true, where:
* `R > P` implies that mutual Bitcoin is preferred by each to mutual Dollar.
* `T > R` and `P > S` imply that Dollar is the dominant strategy for each.

We can conclude that `P > S` holds, as `S` implies no international settlement and therefore no benefit from a [foreign exchange reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign-exchange_reserves), and presumably economic sanctions are undesirable.

To determine if `R > P` and `T > R`, an objective measure is required to relate sanction and seigniorage. This can be obtained by the observation that gold is subject neither to [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) nor sanction. Given that a better alternative exists it would be chosen before Bitcoin.
