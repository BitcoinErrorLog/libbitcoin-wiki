There is a theory that [fractional reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking) banking is a fraud, allowing banks to create [money](Money-Taxonomy) "out of thin air". The theory implies that legitimate banking must be [full reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-reserve_banking).

This theory hinges on the definition of the word "bank". [Rothbard]() makes the above argument, but explicitly limits his [definition of a bank](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/pp/1086) to that of a "warehouse" for money:

> When a man deposits goods at a warehouse, he is given a receipt and pays the owner of the warehouse a certain sum for the service of storage. He still retains ownership of the property; the owner of the warehouse is simply guarding it for him. When the warehouse receipt is presented, the owner is obligated to restore the good deposited. A warehouse specializing in money is known as a "bank."

Banks do offer this warehousing service, in the name of [safe deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_deposit_box). But banks are not so narrowly defined. They also generally offer interest-bearing accounts such as [savings deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account) and [certificates of deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit) respectively. Rothbard uses the expectation of [interest](Glossary#interest) to differentiate warehouse banking from [borrowing](Glossary#borrow) and [lending](Glossary#lend) generally:

> Someone else's property is taken by the warehouse and used for its own money-making purposes. It is not borrowed, since no interest is paid for the use of the money.
