As implied by [Value Proposition](Value-Proposition) there are two aspects of Bitcoin that make it a target of [state](Glossary#state) controls.

In [combating Bitcoin](Other-Means-Principle) the state may attempt to introduce a cosmetically similar money, which can be referred to as Fedcoin. This could be introduced as a [split](Glossary#split) or alternative [coin](Glossary#coin). The objective would be to preserve the superficial aspects of Bitcoin while eliminating its value proposition. This would protect tax revenues while propagandizing Fedcoin as a “safer” alternative to Bitcoin.

The two distinctions from Bitcoin allow the state to arbitrarily create new [units](Glossary#unit) ([seigniorage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage)) and deny [transfer](Glossary#transfer) ([censorship](Glossary#censorship)). The seigniorage objective can be achieved by a [hard fork](Glossary#hard-fork) that introduces one new [consensus rule](Glossary#rule). This rule allows the introduction of new units in the case where the state has signed an inflationary [transaction](Glossary#transaction). The censorship objective can be achieved by a [soft fork](Glossary#soft-fork) that precludes [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) of transactions that lack state signature.

**Preventing the state from compelling these forks is the central purpose of Bitcoin system security.** The [economy](Glossary#economy) guards against the hard fork and [miners](Glossary#miner) guard against the soft fork. The [resistance](Risk-Sharing-Principle) of these [people](Glossary#person) preserves the [value](Glossary#value) of the money relative to state-controlled alternatives.
