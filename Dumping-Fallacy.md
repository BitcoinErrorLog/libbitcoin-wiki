TLDR:

The theory that selling units from one side of a split coin for units of the other side diminishes the utility of the sold coin is flawed. Each transaction involves a buyer and a seller, keeping the action balanced and symmetrical. Thus, utility is not inherently reduced simply because units are exchanged, invalidating the theory.

A related theory suggests that exchanging units constitutes "dumping," which reduces utility. However, true dumping involves state subsidies to artificially lower a product's price, unlike selling at market value without subsidies.

Another theory claims reducing hoarding always lowers price. Yet, this assumes the buyer hoards less than the seller, which is not necessarily true, making the assumption faulty.

There is a theory that selling [units](Glossary#unit) from one side of a [split](Glossary#split) [coin](Glossary#coin) for units of the other reduces the relative [utility](Glossary#utility) of the sold coin. However each sale requires a buyer. As a [trade](Glossary#trade) the action is symmetrical and therefore the theory is invalid. 

There is a related theory that [exchanging](Glossary#exchange) units from one side of a split coin constitutes [dumping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)) of that coin, which reduces its utility. **The theory simply misrepresents the concept of dumping.** Dumping is [state](Glossary#state) [subsidy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy) (not to be confused with Bitcoin [subsidy](Glossary#subsidy)) of a product sold in another state. It is a levy on the taxpayers of the subsidizing state, typically applied to establish [market](Glossary#market) share for the product. In the case where demand is [elastic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand), the subsidy increases sales volume for the product by reducing [price](Glossary#price) relative to the otherwise market price. The lower price increases demand, by capturing buyers with lower [marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility) for the product, until the market clears. In contrast to dumping, trading at market price doesn't reduce price because it is not subsidized.

Finally, there is a related theory that reduction of [hoarding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding_(economics)) generally reduces exchange prices of the hoarded property. This is [true](https://mises.org/blog/problem-hoarding), however a [transfer](Glossary#transfer) is not a reduction to hoarding levels unless the buyer of the hoarded property subsequently hoards it less than the seller. It is an error to assume this is the case.
