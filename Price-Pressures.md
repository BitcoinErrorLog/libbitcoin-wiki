[Price](Glossary#price) stability is an [economic fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value), however it is useful in [speculation](Glossary#speculate) to understand the pressures affecting price. The [exchange](Glossary#exchange) price of a money is is determined by its [supply and demand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) which is in turn affected by the supply and demand schedules of all people for all products. 

We can organize monies into three supply categories:

* Rational supply (commodity)
* Arbitrary supply (fiat)
* Fixed supply (bitcoin)

Commodity money supply increases due to the financial incentive to [produce more](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining) when price is expected to be at or above production cost (inclusive of capital cost). This relationship between price and supply is predictable despite price (and therefore supply) not being so. Because price is not predictable this [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation) cannot be [capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value). Therefore all holders of the money suffer a reduction in [value](Glossary#value) from the increased supply. Competition ensures that this production financed by existing holders is limited to the [capital cost](Glossary#interest). Destruction of the commodity decreases supply and therefore increases value.

Fiat money supply increases due to the financial reward of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) and decreases due to destruction. When this monetary inflation is predictable it can be capitalized, which discounts the advantage of seigniorage. As such changes to supply are often [not published](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy/crisis-hit-venezuela-halts-publication-of-another-major-indicator-idUSKBN16S1YF). Due to [state monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_monopoly) protection (i.e. production is the crime of couterfeit), competition cannot effectively limit returns to capital cost. The resulting sovereign [profit](Glossary#profit) is the reward of seigniorage.

Bitcoin supply is independent of price, which reflects the effect of demand alone. Given that [subsidy]() is predictable it has [no affect on price](Inflation-Fallacy) over time, and is eventually removed altogether.
