[Price](Glossary#price) stability is an [economic fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value), however it is useful in [speculation](Glossary#speculate) to understand the pressures affecting price. The [exchange](Glossary#exchange) price of a money is is determined by its [supply and demand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) which is in turn affected by the supply and demand schedules of all people for all products. 

We can organize monies into three supply categories:

* Rational supply (commodity)
* Arbitrary supply (fiat)
* Fixed supply (bitcoin)

Commodity money supply increases due to the financial incentive to [produce more](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining) when price is expected to be at or above production cost (inclusive of capital cost). This relationship between price and supply is predictable despite price (and therefore supply) not being so. Because price is not predictable this [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation) cannot be [capitalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value). Therefore all holders of the money suffer a reduction in [value](Glossary#value) from the increased supply. Competition ensures that this production financed by existing holders is limited to the [capital cost](Glossary#interest).

does not decrease [value](Glossary#value) because the money costs the same to produce as to purchase.

Fiat money supply increases due to the financial reward of [seigniorage](). Dilution that results in positive seigniorage decreases value because price exceeds production cost which, due to [monopoly]() protection, cannot be corrected by competition.

Bitcoin supply is independent of price, which reflects the effect of demand alone. Given that [subsidy]() is predictable it has [no affect on price](Inflation-Fallacy) over time, and is eventually removed altogether.
