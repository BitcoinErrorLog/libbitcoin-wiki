Bitcoin is not valuable because it is scarce, it becomes more scarce the more highly it is valued.

As an *absolute* concept, [economic scarcity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity) of a resource implies only that it is not available in limitless supply. Nevertheless, if no [person](Glossary#person) demands it, the resource has no [value](Glossary#value). A scarce resource under demand becomes property.

Scarcity may also refer to the *relative* availabity of some property. For a given supply, greater demand implies greater availability. However, increasing demand tends to increase supply, and thereby availability. Similarly, for a given demand, increasing supply tends to decrease demand, and thereby availability. These negative feedbacks [stabalize](Stability-Property) availability and correspondingly [price](Glossary#price).

A single [coin](Glossary#coin) has [fixed supply](Inflation-Fallacy). This is often,incorrectly, considered unique in is the realm of property; there is only one Mona Lisa.
