[Fiat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) money exists to collect [seigniorage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage), which is a [sovereign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) tax on the holding of the money. The tax is levied by manufacture of units of the money denominated above its production cost in the money (i.e. counterfeit). The objective of the tax is to accumulate political power, including [reserve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency) money.

A reserve is the accumulation of a tax [hoard](Glossary#hoard). When the sovereign [state](Glossary#state] collects seigniorage it must do so in another money not subject to the tax. Otherwise the hoard itself would be diminished by the tax. **The existence of a reserve presupposes fiat, as otherwise there is no reason for two monies.** The reserve retains its value despite the purposeful [debasement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debasement) of fiat, and is eventually held primarily by the sovereign. The current (third) United States Federal Reserve was instituted [in 1913](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act).

Initially legal tender laws and taxes create demand for fiat, which must be purchased with the reserve money. Such laws were applied broadly in the United States [in 1862](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Tender_Cases). As reserves accumulate and fiat becomes widely accepted, the sovereign may seize what remains without immediate risk to future tax on other economic activity. This is done in part by abandoning fiat-reserve [convertibility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertibility) and also by direct confiscation. In the United States domestic confiscation and non-convertibility occurred [in 1933](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102) and non-convertibility was applied to nation-state fiat holders [in 1971](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock).

It is common for the fiat money of one sovereign state to become the reserve of another. This allows the issuer of fiat held in reserve by others to transitively tax holders of lower tier fiat. This tax is begrudgingly accepted by other sovereigns in exchange for the ability to [purchase products](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrocurrency) available primarily in the global reserve. Control over access to the [clearing network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_(finance)) of the global reserve is often used as an [economic weapon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication). The US Dollar and to a lesser extent the Euro make up the vast majority of [foreign exchange reserves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_foreign-exchange_reserves_(excluding_gold)).

Fiat is typically "paper" and/or metal currency used alongside account-based money. Since issuance is the source of taxation, money accounts, now largely electronic, are brought under control of the sovereign. As such, fiat issuance is primarily electronic yet euphemistically referred to as "printing" money. This occurred in the United States in 1913, coincident with creation of the reserve system. With the Federal Reserve Act the state gained physical control over a national reserve, the power to issue notes against it, and regulatory control over money accounts.

Electronic money is harder for third parties to counterfeit, and gives the issuer visibility into all financial transactions. This visibility is another tax on users of the money, as it compels increased compliance with independent takings. Avoidance of these takings is referred to as [tax evasion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion) or [money laundering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering) by the state, depending on context. As such we are wit
