The term "reserve" refers to a hoard of capital, as distinct from that portion of savings which is [invested](Glossary#lend). Both [states](Glossary#state) and [people](Glossary#person) hoard capital to satisfy expected liquidity requirements. The term [reserve currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency) refers to a state hoard, as required for [settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(finance)) of accounts with other states. Reserves of people within a state generally consist of the state's issued money - primarily notes or fiat, with a lesser amount in [coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_money).

States buy reserve currency from people using [monopoly money](Money-Taxonomy), [foreign exchange controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls) and direct taxation. Using their own money discounts purchases by the amount of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage). Foreign exchange controls restrict or prohibit use of the reserve currency as money. By treating the reserve currency as property but not money, the state creates a [tax on the apparent capital gain](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/081616/understanding-taxes-physical-goldsilver-investments.asp) in the reserve money when it [devalues its money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) against the reserve money through [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation). Official exchange rates [below market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate#Parallel_exchange_rate) value create another tax on use of the reserve currency.

A "gold standard" is one in which the state collects gold as a foreign exchange reserve, and individuals reserve in claims to a "standard" amount. The U.S. Dollar was [established](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinage_Act_of_1834) as redeemable in gold at $20.67 per ounceâ€‹ in 1834. For 100 years the state bought and sold gold at this rate. In 1934 the Dollar was [devalued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Reserve_Act) by 60%, to $35 per ounce. At this point its redeemability (by people) was abrogated, and it was made unlawful for them to hoard or contract in it. This irredeemably was [extended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock) to other states in 1971, officially ending the gold standard in the United States. No longer a debt of the state, the Dollar transitioned from a [representative currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money) to fiat.

The [U.S. primary foreign exchange reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_reserve) is Gold (74.5%) with the remainder in foreign currency and equivalents, whereas citizens primarily reserve using the Dollar. A state's own notes or fiat is not generally usable in foreign exchange reserve, as the state can abrogate or devalue its debt. The U.S. Treasury reports that it [hoards](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/IR-Position/Pages/01042019.aspx) over 8,000 metric tons of gold, worth approximately $400,000,000,000. The purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar note in 1834 was about 30 times that of U.S. Dollar fiat in 2019.
