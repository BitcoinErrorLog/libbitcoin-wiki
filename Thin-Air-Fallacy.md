There is a theory that [fractional reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking) inherently gives banks the ability to create [money](Money-Taxonomy) at no material cost. The theory does not depend on the [state](Glossary#state) privilege of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage). It is considered a consequence of the accounting practices of [free banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking). This is sometimes referred to as creating money *ex nihilo* or "out of thin air".

Adherents describe two competing views on money creation:

#### Naive View

Money is created by [miners](Glossary#miner) at a material cost, potentially sold to [people](Glossary#person), and eventually [lent](Glossary#lend) to people. This theory holds that the [lender](Glossary#lender) is lending only money he [owns](Glossary#owner). As such the lender is operating at [full reserve](Full-Reserve-Fallacy) and cannot engage in the practice of fractional reserve, which is considered fraudulent. As an honest lender he is only able to issue claims ([money substitutes](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Money_substitutes)) against money in his possession, preventing [credit expansion](Credit-Expansion-Fallacy) and therefore general [price inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation).

#### Practical View

Money substitutes are created by banks, at no material cost, as a consequence of fractional reserve lending. The supply of these substitutes expands with every loan, contracting only as loans are [settled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_(finance)). Given the implied lack of constraint on credit expansion, overall debt grows without bound, creating general [price inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation).

In a free market people can perform the same operations as banks, without necessarily calling themselves banks. Therefore the distinction between these two possibilities must be based on obscuration of the supposed fraud. The theory holds that this obscuration is accomplished using an accounting trick that is not widely understood. So let us investigate the difference. Any money will suffice in this investigation of the money substitutes created in either case, including Gold or Bitcoin.
