Bitcoin has since its inception defied clear definition. This is a consequence of the heavily-overloaded use of the term. The term was coined by Satoshi in [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), as a label for the [essential concepts](Cryptodynamic-Principles). It was later used also for the prototype implementation, a set of [consensus rules](Glossary#consensus-rules), a history of [transaction](Glossary#transaction) [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation), and a [unit](Glossary#unit) of the [coin](Glossary#coin).

While there is only one set of concepts, each of the other contexts has any number of possible variations consistent with them. There are many implementations (of the prototype and otherwise), consensus rules have deviated (in the prototype and in other implementations), history is dynamic and arbitrary (even the prototype-encoded [genesis](Glossary#genesis) [block](Glossary#block) could have been different without consequence), and each coin manifests distinct units.
