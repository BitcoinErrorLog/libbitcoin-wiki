Bitcoin [consensus-rules](Glossary#consensus-rules) produce a predictable rate of [monetary inflation](Glossary#inflation). This rate is reduced periodically at a point called the [halving](Glossary#halving). There are several [step functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_function) in Bitcoin. The halving occurs every 210,000 [strong](Glossary#strong) blocks, the [difficulty](Glossary#difficulty) [adjustment](Glossary#adjustment) every 2,016 strong blocks and [chain](Glossary#chain) [reorganization](Glossary#reorganization) approximately every 10 minutes. The numeric values that control these intervals are arbitrary yet the discontinuity is necessary due to the discrete intervals required for [proof of work](Glossary#proof).

There is a theory that the halving creates a financial cliff for [miners](Glossary#miner) that may lead to a perpetual [stall](Glossary#stall). The theory is based on the confluence of two step functions (halving and difficulty), causing the period of another (reorganization) to expand dramatically. The theory assumes that the difficulty adjustment resets average miner economic profit to zero, allowing only the top 50% of miners to survive over time, eventually reducing [mining](Glossary#mine) to just a few miners. In other words the difficulty adjustment is considered a [pooling pressure](Pooling-Pressure-Risk).

However there is no reason to believe that the adjustment reduces *any* miner's profit to zero. The consequence of the assumption is not that there will be *few* miners, but that there will be *none*, due to the difficulty adjustment alone. The adjustment actually does nothing to regulate miner profits, it controls only the reorganization period. [Time preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference), which dictates [market](Glossary#market) [return on capital](Glossary#interest), regulates miner profits just as it does in every market.

Consider the case of no [price](Glossary#price) change. In this case there is no reason to expect a change in total [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate). There are no adjustments to difficulty, and we can conclude that the average mine generates the market return on capital. Below market return on capital reduces hash rate and above market increases it, as capital chases returns. Addition of hash power decreases profits, discouraging hash power, and reduction of hash power increases profits, encouraging hash power.

In other words, in the absence of price changes, any number of independent miners can compete indefinitely (absent *actual* pooling pressures). However, the case where price is increasing or decreasing is no different than hash power increasing or decreasing, so this conclusion applies generally. Miner profits are expected to always average the market rate of return on capital, and therefore the theory builds on an invalid assumption.

The other assumption of the theory is that [fees](Glossary#fee) are insufficient to [reward](Glossary#reward) miners immediately following a halving. Yet fees are determined in a [market](Glossary#fee) and can certainly rise to any level that [people](Glossary#person) are willing to pay. It is not unusual in markets for supply disruptions to cause price spikes. There is no basis to assume that the financial brunt of such changes is borne by suppliers, or that they are not sufficiently capitalized to weather transitions, and in the case of the halving the event is perfectly predictable.
