A [money](Money-Taxonomy) is often [presumed](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/p/1107) to change in [purchasing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power) in proportion to the demand for goods that it represents. In other words, with twice the amount of money each [unit](Glossary#unit) of the money will [trade](Glossary#trade) for half its previous amount of goods, as the increase in goods implies lower demand for them. This is a [proportional relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)) between [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation) and [price inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) (or deflation). The [money relation](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/778) is an expression of the [law of supply and demand](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand).

* Rising supply market money, such as Gold and [early](Glossary#subsidy) Bitcoin, consumes the same [value](Glossary#value) in goods as it creates in new units - including the [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) of the capital [invested](Glossary#lend) in doing so. **As such it produces no change in proportionality and therefore no price inflation.**

* Monopoly money is not subject to competitive production, allowing its producer to obtain a [monopoly](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/pp/1054) premium in the pricing of new units. As such it increases the proportion of money to goods, resulting in price inflation.

* Falling supply market money, such as late Bitcoin, consumes no goods in the destruction of existing units. As such it decreases the proportion of money to goods, resulting in [price deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation).

With market money, consumption of goods in production occurs during production. With monopoly money the production discount of [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) manifests as an uneven tax. As the new supply is introduced the tax is lower for earlier [trades](Glossary#trade), with [prices](Glossary#price) increasing over time.

The presumption of proportionality refers to the goods "represented" by a money. If there was only one money, this would be a straightforward relation to all goods. However the relation must be addressed in the case of multiple monies. The goods represented by a money are those that are traded for it. In other words, the relation assumes constant demand for the money.

Yet demand does not remain constant in the case of a decision to mine. New demand for the money is created by the fact of mining. The miner trades (consumes in production) additional "representation" capital for the money. The new money is entirely offset by the demand increase, represented by the consumed goods. Therefore proportionality is preserved in the case of multiple monies.

The generalization of this principle applies to all goods. In other words, [economic growth](Depreciation-Principle) is not price-inflationary in a free [market](Glossary#market).

> Changes in the supply of money must necessarily alter the disposition of vendible goods as owned by various individuals and firms. The quantity of money available in the whole market system cannot increase or decrease otherwise than by first increasing or decreasing the cash holdings of certain individual members.

> Mises: [Human Action](https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/778)

This implies that all new money first affects existing “cash holdings”. Yet this is not the case with market money. The creation of it first reduces *goods* holdings, increasing demand for “vendible goods” proportionally. When the money is introduced, it increases the cash holdings of those who produced it, and subsequently others. But the preceding reduction of goods cannot be ignored in evaluation of the money relation. The statement conflates market money with monopoly money, as the latter does not consume its value in goods as a consequence of its production.
