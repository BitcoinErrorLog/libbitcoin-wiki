A [money](Money-Taxonomy) is often [presumed](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/p/1107) to change in [purchasing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power) in proportion to the products it represents. In other words, with twice the amount of money each [unit](Glossary#unit) of the money will [trade](Glossary#trade) for half its previous amount of products. This is a [proportional relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)) between [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation) and [price inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) (or deflation).

Rising supply market money, such as Gold and [early](Glossary#subsidy) Bitcoin, consumes the same [value](Glossary#value) in goods as it creates in new units - including the [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) of the capital invested in doing so. As such it produces no change in proportionality and therefore no price inflation.

Monopoly money is not subject to competitive production, allowing its producer to obtain a [monopoly](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/pp/1054) premium in the pricing of new units. As such it increases the proportion of money to goods, resulting in price inflation.

Falling supply market money, such as late Bitcoin, consumes no goods in the destruction of existing units. As such it decreases the proportion of money to goods, resulting in [price deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation).
