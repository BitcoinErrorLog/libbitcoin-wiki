There is a theory that Bitcoin will lower human [time preference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference).

Value derives from the human perception of [utility](Glossary#utility). A [person](Glossary#person) who trades a car for a horse objectively values the usefulness of [owning](Glossary#owner) the horse more than the car. This implies nothing about *why* one is more valuable than the other to the person. It also implies nothing about the the valuations made by others, or by the same person at any other time. The value placed on one thing over another is a preference. The reason for the preference is not knowable in economic theory.

Time preference is the [axiom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) of economic theory that states all people always value the utility of owning a thing sooner over later. In other words, the value people place on time. According to the [subjective theory of value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value), this idea cannot be proven, it must itself be assumed. Similarly, given that value is subjective, it cannot be shown *why* people value time more or less highly. Finally, given that value is subjective, nothing can be known about what will change a given personâ€™s time preference. It is, as the name implies, a preference.

The [theory of diminishing marginal utility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility) implies that for each additional [unit](Glossary#unit) of a given thing acquired by a person, the usefulness of a unit declines. This implies that, for a given time preference and [interest](Glossary#interest) rate, increased wealth implies a greater willingness to [lend](Glossary#lend). Similarly, a higher interest rate implies a greater willingness for a person of a given time preference to lend. It is a fundamental error to assume that either interest rates or wealth imply any change to time preference. Human preferences can change for any number of reasons, but the actual reasons are unknowable. By reversing cause and effect, such an error invalidates all conclusions, invalidating the theory. **Bitcoin helps people express their preferences, it implies no attempt to change them.**

A related theory states that lower time preference is objectively better than higher. The theory presumes an objective morality (a basis for determining vale). Economics does not make value judgements, it infers their necessary consequence. Aggression merely differentiates the free [market](Glossary#market) from market intervention, such as by the [state](Glossary#state). However, if one accepts [nonaggression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle) as the moral divide, no moral distinction between higher and lower time preference exists.

Infinite time preference implies no lending and therefore no production. Zero time preference implies no consumption of what is produced. Given that the production exists only to satisfy eventual consumption, zero time preference also implies no production, as there is no value attributable to the consumption of products. So even absent a moral distinction, assuming people want products, no given time preference is inherently more successful in delivering them.

Wealth is nothing more than people satisfying preferences, including those for present and deferred consumption. In the attempt to maximize tax revenue, states employ contradictory market interventions. Fiscal and monetary [stimulus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)) are employed to increase consumption and increase production respectively. Yet both come at the cost of taxing both. The outcome is the shifting of capital allocation decisions from the market to the state. This implies people are less able to *satisfy* preferences. However it implies no change to actual preferences.

It can be enlightening to consider subjectivity in terms of sexual preference.

* `{ X, Y }`
* `{ X->X, Y->Y }`
* `{ X->X|Y, Y->X|Y }`
* `{ X->Y, Y->X }`

One might consider these groups ordered in terms of increasing productivity (i.e. producing more humans). Many states attempt to reduce the expression of these sexual preferences to the set `{ X->Y, Y->X }`. Both outright [criminalization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory) of expression and explicit [financial incentive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_promotion) for it are employed to this end. This has a discernible impact on *expression* of sexual preference, but cannot be said to have any impact on the preference itself.

Similarly it should be clear that an increase in productivity is not objectively good. People doing what they want is the moral good, again assuming the moral principle of nonaggression. Even if we assume all people prefer continuation of the species, this implies no effect on individual sexual preferences.
