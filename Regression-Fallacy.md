The [Regression Theorem](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Regression_theorem) relies on the assumption that the first [people](Glossary#person) to [value](Glossary#value) something as a money must do so based on a memory of its prior [use value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value), with the thing eventually obtaining [barter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barter) [utility](Glossary#utility) and finally monetary value. The theorem is invalid based on three internal contradictions.

The theorem contradicts the [subjective theory of value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value) upon which it relies. Value is subjective, which implies it can be based on anything, even if objectively that basis appears irrational.

**The theorem fails to terminate its regression by not explaining how a person comes to value something for its *original* utility.** One must *assume* (not remember) something will be useful if nobody has ever attempted to use it. This assumption of utility is the first valuation, which remains subjective. The first valuation of a thing, like all after, can be for any reason, including its utility as a money. This is inherent in the concept of subjective value.

The theorem is based on empirical observation of monetary evolution. Yet the [rational economic theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics) on which it is based inherently rejects empiricism. One of many problems with empirical economics is that new observations can invalidate previous conclusions. Bitcoin has done so to this theorem. It can clearly be observed that Satoshi [intended to create a money](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), for its first use as money.
