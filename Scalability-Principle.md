The nature of [Bitcoin stability](Stability-Property) implies an inherent economic pressure precluding [linear scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability). The [block] size limit [consensus rule](Glossary#rule) establishes the arbitrary trade-off between [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Principle) and system security, yet at any block size the system remains non-scalable due to the necessity of [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) finality.

This raises the question of whether sufficient demand can exist to secure Bitcoin, given the requirement for risk sharing. Aggregate demand can be increased through the use of off-chain confirmation for below-threshold scenarios, settled on chain. This represents an individual security compromise (for lower-value transactions), avoiding a system security compromise (for all transactions). This cost-security compromise produces its own limit. In other words Bitcoin stability is a consequence of inherent non-scalability. This stability implies price is not unbounded but can rise with scalability improvements.
