The nature of [Bitcoin stability](Stability-Property) implies an inherent economic pressure precluding [linear scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability). The [block](Glossary#block) size limit [consensus rule](Glossary#rule) establishes the arbitrary trade-off between [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Property) and system security. Yet at any block size the system remains non-scalable due to the necessity of [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) finality. In other words, a finite set of [transactions](Glossary#transaction) must be selected, which implies that others may be excluded, necessitating a competitive [fee](Glossary#fee) [market](Glossary#market) for inclusion.

Effective transaction carrying capacity, and therefore aggregate demand, can be increased through the use of off-[chain](Glossary#chain) [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) [settled on chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network). This represents an *individual* and *time-limited* security compromise (for lower-value transactions), avoiding a *system-wide* and *persistent* security compromise (for all transactions). This compromise lowers but does not eliminate the utility threshold. As such the coin remains both non-scalable and stable.
