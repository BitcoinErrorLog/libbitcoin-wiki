[Scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability) is the proportional increase in some aspect of performance as more hardware is employed. Bitcoin [transaction](Glossary#transaction) throughput is perfectly non-scalable as no amount of hardware increases it.

The [block](Glossary#block) size limit [consensus rule](Glossary#rule) establishes the arbitrary trade-off between [utility](Glossary#utility) and system security. Increased block size marginally increases transaction throughput and the resource cost of [transaction](Glossary#transaction) validation (i.e. processing, storage, and bandwidth). As the cost of [validation](Glossary#validation) increases, [economic](Glossary#economy) security is adversely affected by increased [centralization risk](Centralization-Risk).

As the trade-off is arbitrary, there is no ideal size. Additionally, at any block size the system remains non-scalable due to the necessity of [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) finality. In other words, a finite set of transactions must be selected, which implies that others may be excluded, necessitating a competitive [market](Glossary#market) for inclusion. This market also finances confirmation security in proportion to demand for the money.

Effective transaction carrying capacity, and therefore aggregate demand, can be increased through the use of [layering](Glossary#layering). This represents a *local* and *time-limited* security compromise, in contrast to the *system-wide* and *persistent* security compromise of increasing block size. Either compromise lowers but does not eliminate the [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Property), which implies [stability](Stability-Property) is preserved.

**Therefore stability and non-scalability exist at any block size and level of layering.**
