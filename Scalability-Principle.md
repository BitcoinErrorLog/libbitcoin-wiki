The nature of [Bitcoin stability](Stability-Property) implies an inherent economic pressure precluding [linear scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability). Scalability is the proportional increase in some aspect of performance as more hardware is applied. Bitcoin is perfectly non-scalable as no amount of hardware increases [transaction](Glossary#transaction) throughput.

The [block](Glossary#block) size limit [consensus rule](Glossary#rule) establishes the arbitrary trade-off between [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Property) and system security. Yet at any block size the system remains non-scalable due to the necessity of [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) finality. In other words, a finite set of [transactions](Glossary#transaction) must be selected, which implies that others may be excluded, necessitating a competitive [fee](Glossary#fee) [market](Glossary#market) for inclusion.

Effective transaction carrying capacity, and therefore aggregate demand, can be increased through the use of off-[chain](Glossary#chain) [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) [settled on chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) (layering). This represents a *local* and *time-limited* security compromise, in contrast to the *system-wide* and *persistent* security compromise that results from expanded block size. Either compromise lowers but does not eliminate the utility threshold.

**As such stability and non-scalability exist at any block size and level of layering.**
