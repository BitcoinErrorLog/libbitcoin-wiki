The nature of [Bitcoin stability](Stability-Property) implies an inherent economic pressure precluding [linear scalability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability). The [block](Glossary#block) size limit [consensus rule](Glossary#rule) establishes the arbitrary trade-off between [utility threshold](Utility-Threshold-Property) and system security. Yet at any block size the system remains non-scalable due to the necessity of [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) finality. In other words, a finite set of [transactions](Glossary#transaction) must be selected, which implies that others may be excluded, necessitating a competitive [fee](Glossary#fee) [market](Glossary#market) for inclusion.

Aggregate demand can be increased through the use of off-[chain](Glossary#chain) [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) for below-threshold scenarios, settled on chain. This represents an *individual* security compromise (for lower-value transactions), avoiding a *system* security compromise (for all transactions). This cost-security compromise produces its own limit. In other words Bitcoin stability is a consequence of inherent non-scalability. This stability implies price is not unbounded but can rise with scalability improvements.
