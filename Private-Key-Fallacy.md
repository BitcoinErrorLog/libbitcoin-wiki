Private keys do not secure Bitcoin, they secure [units](Glossary#unit) of Bitcoin. Private key control applies to individual security, not system security. Whoever controls keys is the [owner](Glossary#owner), and Bitcoin provides security for that owner, even if the keys are stolen. Decentralized [validation](Glossary#validation) secures [consensus](Glossary#consensus) and [majority hash power](Glossary#majority-hash-power) secures [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation), but private key security is the owner's problem.

System weakness results from lack of decentralized validation. Consensus [risk is shared](Risk-Sharing-Principle) among active [merchants](Glossary#merchant) only. The risk of [delegation](Glossary#delegation) is that it is commonly coupled with [centralization](Glossary#centralization), as is typical in [web wallets](https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/web). The wallet not only owns the units but controls validation of received units.
