Private keys do not secure Bitcoin, they secure [units](Glossary#unit) of Bitcoin. Private key control applies to [individual](Glossary#person) security, not system security. Whoever controls keys is the [owner](Glossary#owner), and Bitcoin provides security for that owner, even if the keys are stolen. Decentralized [validation](Glossary#validation) secures [consensus](Glossary#consensus) and [majority hash power](Glossary#majority-hash-power) secures [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation), but private key security is the owner's problem.
