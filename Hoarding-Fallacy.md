There is a theory that an increased level of [hoarding](Glossary#hoard) produces an increased level of security in a [coin](Glossary#coin). This is the similar to the [Dumping Fallacy](Dumping-Fallacy) but is not necessarily based on a [split](Glossary#split).

An increase can only be described relative to some base level. If a [person](Glossary#person) can be convinced that there is increased system security in a higher collective hoarding level, the theory holds that the person may decide to hoard more than would otherwise be optimal. This amounts to an actual individual cost with a presumed socialized benefit. In other words the theory depends on irrational economic behavior, even if the security benefit is actual.
