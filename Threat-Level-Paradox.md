As explained in [Zero Sum Property](Zero-Sum-Property), the only way to defeat external [subsidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy) is to [mine](Glossary#mine) at a capital loss relative to [market](Glossary#market) return on capital. The only way to defeat tax, up to and including a 100% tax (prohibition), is to mine beyond the reach of the taxing authority, such as in secret. As with all [black markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market) there is an increased cost to [subversive mining](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/big-in-venezuela/534177). Competing against subsidized mining compounds the cost.

If one accepts the [axiom of resistance](Axiom-of-Resistance) one must assume that both tax and subsidy will be used to reduce the cost of [controlling](Glossary#power) Bitcoin. In order to enjoy the benefits of a hard currency, [people](Glossary#person) will ultimately have to mine at a loss relative to the average [market](Glossary#market) return on capital. However [states](Glossary#state) will need to incur the same cost in order to continue to extract that penalty, either through subsidy or tax enforcement. This is the lever that Bitcoin provides for defense against market aggression, a tool to nullify [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage).

**Paradoxically, this tool works well when money is under attack and poorly otherwise.** If there was no [internal](Glossary#consensus-rules) [pooling-pressure](Pooling-Pressure-Risk) these cases would be balanced. But [risk distribution](Risk-Sharing-Principle) is essential to subversive mining, and pooling pressure works *against* distribution. So there is ever-expanding [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface) (e.g. China) with no pressure to contract unless effective monetary alternatives are suppressed (e.g. Venezuela). The [suppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_controls) of alternatives raises [reward](Glossary#reward) [utility](Glossary#utility) to the miner in the region of suppression. The paradox applies as well to [centralization pressures](Centralization-Risk).

The expected consequence is that Bitcoin will not be well *prepared* for [attacks](Glossary#attack) because it is financially disadvantageous for [people](Glossary#person) in a low threat environment.
