As explained in [Zero Sum Property](Zero-Sum-Property), the only way to defeat external [subsidy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy) is to [mine](Glossary#mine) at a capital loss relative to market return on capital ([opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost)). The only way to defeat tax, up to and including a 100% tax (prohibition), is to mine in secret. As with all [black markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market) there is an increased cost to [subversive mining](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/big-in-venezuela/534177). Competing against subsidized mining compounds the cost.

If one considers [states](Glossary#state) a [threat](Axiom-of-Resistance) to hard currency one must assume that both tax and subsidy will be used to reduce the cost of achieving [control](Glossary#power) over Bitcoin. In order to enjoy the benefits of a hard currency, [people](Glossary#person) will ultimately have to mine at a loss. However states will need to incur the same cost in order to continue to extract that penalty, either through subsidy or tax enforcement. This is the lever that Bitcoin provides to people for defense against [market](Glossary#market) aggression, a tool to nullify [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage).

**Paradoxically, this tool works well when money is under attack and poorly otherwise.** If there was no [internal](Glossary#consensus-rules) [pooling-pressure](Pooling-Pressure-Risk) these cases would be balanced. But [risk distribution](Risk-Sharing-Principle) is essential to subversive mining, and pooling pressure works *against* distribution. So there is ever-expanding attack surface (e.g. China) with no pressure to contract unless effective monetary alternatives are suppressed (e.g. Venezuela). The suppression of alternatives raises [reward](Glossary#reward) [utility](Glossary#utility) to the miner lacking alternatives.

The expected consequence of this design is that Bitcoin will not be well *prepared* for [attacks](Glossary#attack) because it is financially disadvantageous for [people](Glossary#person) in a low threat environment.
