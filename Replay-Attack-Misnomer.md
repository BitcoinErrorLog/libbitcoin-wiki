Following a [split](Glossary#split) it may be possible for the [spend](Glossary#spend) of certain [outputs](Glossary#output) to be [confirmed](Glossary#confirmation) on both the original [coin](Glossary#coin) [chain](Glossary#chain) and the split coin chain. In other words the recipient obtains [units](Glossary#unit) in both chains, known as "replay".

There is a theory that this dual confirmation constitutes an "attack" on the spender of the spent output. The theory assumes that the spender intends for the [transaction](Glossary#transaction) to spend outputs in one coin but not the other, though there is no way to actually identify the spender's intent. This fact alone would be sufficient to consider the term "attack" incorrect.

The split converts 1 unit on one chain into 2 units, 1 on each of the chains. The theory assumes that the 2 units, at least initially, represent the [utility](Glossary#utility) of the 1 unit prior to the split. In other words the combined chains have a certain [capitalization](Glossary#capitalization) which is divided between the coins, analogous to a [stock split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split).
