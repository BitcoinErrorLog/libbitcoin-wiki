A reserve is the capital a [person](Glossary#person) possesses. It is present capital, as opposed to [invested](Glossary#lend) capital. Present capital [depreciates](Depreciation-Principle) and as such represents an ongoing cost to its [owner](Glossary#owner). The ratio of reserved to invested capital is a reflection of the ownerâ€™s [time preference](Time-Preference-Fallacy).
