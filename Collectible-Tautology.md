In attempting to apply the [Regression Theorem]() to Bitcoin one may postulate that Bitcoin began as a “collectible”, arising from interest by monetary theorists. The collectible obtained original [use value]() due to their personal preferences. It was then [bartered]() as a consequence of this [value](), transitioning to a [medium of exchange]() based on the memory of barter value.

This appears consistent with the theorem, which argues that all [money]() *must* originate from a [commodity]() that obtains barter and then monetary [exchange]() value. Yet if commodity value can arise from potential as money then the theorem is [tautological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology), implying nothing more than money is money.

The postulate takes advantage of colloquial ambiguity in the word “commodity”. Yet if anything can be a commodity then the theorem would imply, contrary to its assertion, that anything can be money.

> In economics, a commodity is an economic good or service that has full or substantial fungibility: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them. [...]

>  Most commodities are raw materials, basic resources, agricultural, or mining products, such as iron ore, sugar, or grains like rice and wheat. Commodities can also be mass-produced unspecialized products such as chemicals and computer memory.

The theorem uses “commodity” to distinguish money from something with no original use value.
