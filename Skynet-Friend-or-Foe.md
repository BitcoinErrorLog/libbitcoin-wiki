Blockstream has announced a network that, "[broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain from space](https://blockstream.com/satellite)." There are several use cases outlined in a [FAQ](https://blockstream.com/satellite/faq/) and [CSO interview](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/wiki/Translation:-Bitcoin-Satellite-Mining-Decentralization):

## Free Services

#### Using Bitcoin
> More people participating in bitcoin means a more decentralized network... [M]akes bitcoin more robust and bullet-proof...

#### Covertly Using Bitcoin
> [I]nternet traffic patterns from running a node can identify you as a bitcoin user. [T]here’s no internet involved to receive the blockchain data, so your patterns are private to you.

#### Partition Resistance
> Without [redundancy] your ability to use the bitcoin network is limited, including your security against sybils... [P]rovides a redundant connection to the blockchain that doesn’t require internet. 

## Paid Services

#### Web (sky) API
> We have plans to extend the network over time to be an open platform for application developers to build on.

#### Payment Processor
> When we make available advanced features, capabilities, and services intended for business use, we plan on monetizing those.

#### Mining Relay
> Bitcoin mining is more delay sensitive and access to lower delay signals optimized for mining is one of the future services we plan to charge for.
