Blockstream has announced a network that, "[broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain from space](https://blockstream.com/satellite)." There are several use cases outlined in a [FAQ](https://blockstream.com/satellite/faq/) and [CSO interview](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/wiki/Translation:-Bitcoin-Satellite-Mining-Decentralization):

#### Using Bitcoin
> More people participating in bitcoin means a more decentralized network... [M]akes bitcoin more robust and bullet-proof...

#### Covertly Using Bitcoin
> [I]nternet traffic patterns from running a node can identify you as a bitcoin user. [T]here’s no internet involved to receive the blockchain data, so your patterns are private to you. Especially since outgoing transactions do not make easily detected traffic patterns.

#### Partition Resistance
> Without [a redundant connection] your ability to use the bitcoin network is limited, including your security against sybils, especially since a compromise of your ISP or ISP’s upstreams can filter your access to the network. There have been several papers on Bitcoin’s vulnerability to internet route hijacking. [P]rovides a redundant connection to the blockchain that doesn’t require internet. 

#### Web (sky) API [paid]
> We have plans to extend the network over time to be an open platform for application developers to build on.

#### Payment Processor [paid]
> When we make available advanced features, capabilities, and services intended for business use, we plan on monetizing those.

#### Mining Relay [paid]
> Bitcoin mining is more delay sensitive and access to lower delay signals optimized for mining is one of the future services we plan to charge for.
>
> Currently only downloads, but there is a possibility that the mining really changes when uploading parts become available with low latency. Since it is not necessary to connect to the transmission line, mining is possible in places where electric power can be obtained anywhere in the world.
