Blockstream has announced a network that, "[broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain from space](https://blockstream.com/satellite)." There are several use cases outlined in a [FAQ](https://blockstream.com/satellite/faq/) and [CSO interview](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/wiki/Translation:-Bitcoin-Satellite-Mining-Decentralization):

## Free Services
The company provides the equivalent of a single [node](Glossary#node) on the [peer-to-peer](Glossary#peer-to-peer)  network. Nearly any [person](Glossary#person) on Earth can connect to this node using an inexpensive receiver. In the initial deployment the node broadcasts but does not receive.

#### New Bitcoin Users
> More people participating in bitcoin means a more decentralized network... [M]akes bitcoin more robust and bullet-proof...

To the extent that this enables new users it implies those users are entirely dependent on this one node. If the user already has access through the Internet (for example) it is not new participation.

#### Covert Bitcoin Usage
> [I]nternet traffic patterns from running a node can identify you as a bitcoin user. [T]here’s no internet involved to receive the blockchain data, so your patterns are private to you.

To the extent that this enables convert use it implies such users are entirely dependent on this one node. The scenario precludes redundant access through the Internet (for example) unless it is also private.

#### Partition Resistance
> Without [redundancy] your ability to use the bitcoin network is limited, including your security against sybils... [P]rovides a redundant connection to the blockchain that doesn’t require internet. 

To the extent that this is necessary it implies that users are almost entirely dependent on this one node. Otherwise access through the Internet (for example) does not suffer from persistent "limiting" of usability.

It is possible that other similar networks may be deployed by independent operators. This would resolve the dependency on the single node. Nevertheless, success implies that a substantial number of people will become entirely dependent upon just a few nodes, all operating with [state](Glossary#state) licenses. This is not the same as having a similarly small number of Internet providers, since thousands of independently operated nodes are potentially reachable through any number of protocols. As such the most compelling scenario may be North Korea, where Internet is impossible and the risk of a dependency on a few state-licensed providers is a reasonable trade-off against oppressive currency controls.

## Paid Services
The company plans to charge for the following services. It is not reasonable to expect *any* services be offered for free, however it is important to the strength of [consensus](Glossary#consensus) for people to understand [centralization](Centralization-Risk) and [pooling pressure](Pooling-Pressure-Risk) risks.

#### Web (sky) API
> We have plans to extend the network over time to be an open platform for application developers to build on.

Details are thin...

#### Payment Processor
> When we make available advanced features, capabilities, and services intended for business use, we plan on monetizing those.

Details are thin...

#### Mining Relay
> Bitcoin mining is more delay sensitive and access to lower delay signals optimized for mining is one of the future services we plan to charge for.

The intent of this service is clear...
