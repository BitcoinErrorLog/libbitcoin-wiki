Bitcoin is an [act of resistance](Axiom-of-Resistance), an attempt to "gain a new territory of freedom."

Freedom contracts through the constant pressure of compulsory financing of the [state](Glossary#state). It is typical that freedom is expanded through bloodshed, with the specific objective of reducing state power. Bitcoin cannot eliminate the need for personal risk in achieving this objective. However, through [risk sharing](Risk-Sharing-Principle) it can potentially reduce the [inflation tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) without spilling blood. This will not eliminate tax, however it will reduce state power by making tax significantly more visible.
