*The Bitcoin Development Library*

### About Libbitcoin

The libbitcoin toolkit is a set of cross platform C++ libraries for building bitcoin applications. The toolkit consists of several libraries, most of which depend on the foundational [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin) library. Each library's repository can be cloned and built using common [automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake) 1.14+ instructions. There are no packages yet in distribution however each library includes an installation script which is regularly verified in the automated build.

If you encounter problems or have suggestions please use the [issues board](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/issues).
