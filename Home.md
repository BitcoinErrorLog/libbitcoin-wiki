*The Bitcoin Development Library*

### About Libbitcoin

The libbitcoin toolkit is a set of cross platform C++ libraries for building bitcoin applications. The toolkit consists of several libraries, most of which depend on the foundational [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin) library. Each library's repository can be cloned and built using common [automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake) 1.14+ instructions (or Visual Studio 2013 on Windows). There are no packages yet in distribution however each library includes an installation script which is regularly verified in the automated build.
