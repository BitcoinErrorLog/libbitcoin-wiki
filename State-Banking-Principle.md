There is no actual [lender of last resort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender_of_last_resort) in [free banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_banking), it implies just another [lender](Glossary#lend) subject to the constraints demonstrated in [Thin Air Fallacy](Thin-Air-Fallacy). However, in [state](Glossary#state) banking this is the [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank), supported by the taxpayer. The state taxes to provide [discount loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_window) to [member banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System#Member_Banks). The loans must be at a [discount to market rates](https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/pages/discount-rates/current-discount-rates) as otherwise it doesn't constitute a last resort. Banks always have the option to [borrow](Glossary#borrow) from other banks and potential depositors. Taxation is necessary to support the discount (i.e. cheap [money](Money-Taxonomy)). So if the economic rate of [interest](Glossary#interest) is 10%, the state may lend to member banks at 3% and cover the difference with taxes.

The state has many sources of tax revenue, but typically central banks subsidize discount rates with [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage). Central banks are known for proclaiming that they do not "print money", but this is exactly what they do. The [U.S. Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve) ("Fed") has the power to [order new money](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed01.html) from the U.S. Treasury's [Bureau of Engraving and Printing](https://www.moneyfactory.gov). The Fed pays the [printing cost](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm) for "paper" money ([actually cloth](https://www.moneyfactory.gov/hmimpaperandink.html)) and face value for [coinage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin). The Treasury is just the contractor that performs the work. Typically coinage is produced such that it has higher face value than [use value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value), in order to prevent [disappearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law) of the coins.

This implies that the [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation) of state fiat is literally the consequence of printing the "paper" money. This process is obscured somewhat. The Fed does not first print the money, stuff it in a vault, and then lend it out. This is unnecessary. The order is reversed in practice. The Fed issues discounted loans, with the *presumption* of money in its vault. The [settlement process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedwire) established by the Fed maintains track of how much money is in each member bank's reserve. The bulk of settlements can often be [netted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-off_(law)#Close_out_netting), but periodically money must be physically moved.

To further reduce transportation costs, a significant portion of member bank reserves are required to be held in the Fed's own vault. This can be achieved by purchasing [Treasury Securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security) that are [offered for sale](https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/a-closer-look-at-open-market-operations) by the Fed. These are [money substitutes](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Money_substitutes) considered sufficient to satisfy member bank reserve requirements. Treasurys are debt issued by the U.S. Treasury and generally purchased in bulk by the Fed. The Fed reduces the yield of Treasuries (i.e. the rate of interest paid by the state) by providing increased demand. It funds these operations in the same essential manner as discounted loans to its member banks. The distinction is merely that these purchases are discounted loans to the state.

The Fed can *pretend* it has money in its vault and print it only as required for settlement. This creates the illusion of monetary inflation being the result of lending. But it is actually entirely the result of the Fed's ability to create money, thereby funding the loans. When a member bank requires money it can buy it from the Fed using Treasury Securities. When the Fed's reserve of actual money is insufficient, it simply makes a "withdrawal" from the taxpayer by demanding money from the printer (i.e. inflation tax).

Without this ability create new fiat the Fed would be unable to settle accounts, just as would any bank, if there was insufficient reserve (including that which could be borrowed) to cover withdrawals and defaults. Until the member bank must settle in fiat, such as in the case of cash withdrawal at [ATMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine), [teller windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_teller) or with non-member banks and other institutions, there is no need to move the actual money, or print it. But without the ability to print it, the Fed would be subject to default just as any other bank.

Given these facts, one would expect the level of money substitutes to be no greater than the product of coinage + fiat (including fiat not yet printed) in circulation, and the "[money multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_multiplier)" implied by bank reserve requirements:

> In equations, writing M for commercial bank money (loans) [money substitutes], R for reserves (central bank money) [money], and RR for the reserve ratio, the reserve ratio requirement is that `R/M >= RR`; the fraction of reserves must be at least the reserve ratio. Taking the reciprocal, `M/R <= 1/RR`, which yields `M <= R x (1/RR)`, meaning that commercial bank money is at most `R x 1/RR`, the latter being the multiplier ignoring leakages into currency [money held outside of banks].

Bank [reserve requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement#United_States) in the U.S. are as follows, implying a minimum reserve ratio of less than than 10%:

> A depository institution's reserve requirements vary by the dollar amount of NTAs [Net Transaction Accounts] held by customers of that institution. Effective January 18, 2018, institutions with net transactions accounts:
>
> * Of less than $16 million have no minimum reserve requirement;
> * Between $16 million and $122.3 million must have a liquidity ratio of 3% of NTAs;
> * Exceeding $122.3 million must have a liquidity ratio of 10% of NTAs.

The total amount of [U.S. Dollars in circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#United_States) is referred to as M0:

> M0: The total of all physical currency including coinage. M0 = Federal Reserve Notes + US Notes + Coins. It is not relevant whether the currency is held inside or outside of the private banking system as reserves.

[According to the U.S. Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12773.htm), at the end of January 2019, there was approximately $1,700,000,000,000 of money in circulation:

> There was approximately $1.70 trillion in circulation as of January 31, 2019. This figure includes Federal Reserve notes ($1,655.2 billion), U.S. notes ($0.2 billion), currency no longer issued ($0.2 billion), and coins outstanding ($47.2 billion).

However money accounted for but not yet printed is [not included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#United_States) above, so we cannot rely on this number:

> In the United States, a bank's reserves consist of U.S. currency held by the bank (also known as "vault cash") plus the bank's balances in Federal Reserve accounts. For this purpose, paper currency on hand and balances in Federal Reserve ("Fed") accounts are interchangeable (both are obligations of the Fed).

The [total amount](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m0) of U.S. Dollars accounted for in May 2019 was approximately $3,250,000,000,000. Incidentally the difference between this amount and "money in circulation" as reported by the Fed is the amount accounted for but not yet printed, or $1,550,000,000,000.

The sum of all U.S. Dollar money and money substitutes is referred to as M3:

> * M1: The total amount of M0 (cash/coin) outside of the private banking system plus the amount of demand deposits, travelers checks and other checkable deposits
> * M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small denomination time deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
> * M3: M2 + all other CDs (large time deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of [eurodollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar) and [repurchase agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement).

[According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S), M3 was $14,613,500,000,000 in May of 2015, the last date provided. [According to the OECD](https://data.oecd.org/money/broad-money-m3.htm), M3 in May 2019 was 121% of M3 in 2015, or $17,682,335,000,000.

The amount of money substitutes is the difference between M3 and M0, or $14,432,335,000,000. The actual reserve ratio is therefore $3,250,000,000,000 divided by $14,432,335,000,000, or 22.52%. Given that the reserve requirement is no more than 10%, the level of [credit expansion](Credit-Expansion-Fallacy) is less than half that allowed by law. This implies that time preference, not the regulatory reserve requirement, is currently controlling the rate of credit expansion. Assuming uniformity of reserves, this would imply a progression of loans at a reserve rate of 18.38% on each loan (i.e. the ratio of hoarding to lending).

While these numbers exclude the expansion implied by private U.S. Dollar lending, it seems clear that credit expansion by banks is limited by both money and time preference. However, there is a significant amount of money available should lending increase due to lowering of time preferences. As this money starts competing for goods as opposed to sitting in vaults, a significant increase in [price inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) should be expected. This highlights the point that monetary inflation alone does not immediately create price inflation, but instead is its harbinger.

As borrowing by member banks is reduced (by the Fed raising its cost), the Fed's "vault money" can be destroyed with the opposite effect of its printing. While the Fed has contracted M0 [by almost 20%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m0) in the four years since its peak in 2015, as negative seigniorage this comes at a cost to tax revenue. The Fed itself operates as a non-profit organization, so net income derived from its loans to member banks is [remitted to the U.S. Treasury](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2018/september/fed-payments-treasury-rising-interest-rates) annually.

> The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate target seven times since between Dec. 2015 and June 2018. This has implications for the path of the federal deficit and federal debt in two ways:
> 
> * Directly through net interest payments
> * Indirectly through the yearly remittances from the Fed to the U.S. Treasury Department
>
>The yearly remittances to the Treasury are essentially the leftover Fed revenue after operating expenses. By law, this additional revenue must be turned over to the Treasury.
> 
>The revenue sent to the Treasury peaked at $97.7 billion in 2015 and has been steadily falling since. In January, the Fed sent $80.2 billion to the Treasury.

This "leftover Fed revenue" is that which is earned, after operating expenses, from loans of money printed by the U.S. Treasury at nominal cost, guaranteed by its [monopoly protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit) in doing so. So the net result is that the Treasury prints new money and then recaptures the money earned as interest that money printed. While the money is not printed and then deposited directly into the Treasury, the result is the same.

State [monopoly money](Money-Taxonomy) is not created *ex nihilo* by fraudulent bank accounting. It is literally created from [old blue jeans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/12/16/how-tight-jeans-almost-ruined-americas-money) by the state.

The transition to a modern "[cashless society](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/business/sweden-cashless-society.html)" implies that central banks would retain the existing form of accounting for not-yet-printed fiat, and simply perform all settlement internally. A digital fiat, such as the experimental [e-Krona](https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments--cash/e-krona), would be required for people to transact with state money electronically. Bitcoin serves the same purpose, but without state control of either [issuance](Glossary#inflation) or [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation).
