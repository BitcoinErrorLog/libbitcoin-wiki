There is a theory that off-[chain](Glossary#chain) [fees](Glossary#fee) are illegitimate. The theory holds that a [merchant](Glossary#merchant) paying a [miner](Glossary#miner) "on the side" to [confirm](Glossary#confirmation) the merchant's [transactions](Glossary#transaction) prevents other merchants' transactions from being confirmed, or that it raises the cost of those confirmations.

One impact of such arrangements is that an average *historical* fee rate cannot be determined through chain analysis. The apparent rate would be lower than the [market](Glossary#market) rate. This could of course lead spenders to underestimate a sufficient fee. However there is no aspect of Bitcoin that requires future fees to equal some average of past fees. Estimation would necessarily compensate. Ignoring "free" transactions in full [blocks](Glossary#block) would be a reasonable start.

Another impact is that disparate relative fee levels can highlight certain transactions as being associated with such arrangements. This can contribute to [taint](Glossary#taint) of the merchant's transaction and/or the miner's [coinbase](Glossary#coinbase). But given the arrangement is a choice made by the creators of the transactions, there is no privacy loss.

There is no impact on market fee rates or the ability others to obtain confirmations. If the arrangement deviates from market rates then either the merchant or the miner is accepting an unnecessary loss. This is no different the miner confirming transactions with below-market on-chain fees or the merchant overestimating on-chain fees, respectively.

Furthermore, unless the miner's [hash power](Glossary#hash-power) is 100%, the merchant is increasing his/her average confirmation times by paying a side-fee at what is otherwise a market rate. This implies the merchant should pay a lower rate, in proportion to the miner's hash power. Without understanding this effect one may misinterpret the actual effective rate in such arrangements.

Bitcoin provides a mechanism for on-chain fees so that a transactions can compensate *any* miner without having to know the miner's [identity](Glossary#identity). It is a privacy-preserving convenience. However if miners and merchants want to weaken their privacy by performing additional tasks, nobody else has any basis to consider that illegitimate. This theory is therefore invalid.
