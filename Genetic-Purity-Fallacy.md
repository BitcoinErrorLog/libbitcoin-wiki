There is a theory that a [coin](Glossary#coin) is strongest when [validation](Glossary#validation) is performed by a common implementation. According to this theory the complexity of [consensus rule](Glossary#consensus-rules) implementation implies a likelihood that multiple implementations will diverge, resulting an inadvertent [chain](Glossary#chain) [split](Glossary#split). The split implies financial loss by [people](Glossary#person) on the [weaker](Glossary#strong) side of the split.

Based on the assumption of high complexity, each update to the "one true client" produces the same likelihood of divergence. Similarly, dependency on external independently updated libraries has the same effect. In the case of the initial Bitcoin implementation both [upgrade of the client](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki) and [upgrade of an external dependency](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki#motivation) have resulted in unintended chain splits and [material financial loss](https://cointelegraph.com/news/miners-lost-over-50000-from-the-bitcoin-hardfork-last-weekend).
