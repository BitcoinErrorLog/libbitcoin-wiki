[Latency](Glossary#latency) is the time required for [communication](Glossary#communication). Information moves at a speed not greater than the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) and therefore latency cannot be eliminated. Different distances between [miners](Glossary#miner) implies [announcements](Glossary#announcement) will be known to some before others.

While a [miner](Glossary#miner) remains unaware of an announcement he wastes capital [grinding](Glossary#grind) on an [weak](Glossary#weak) [candidate](Glossary#candidate). As more time passes it becomes exponentially less likely that the miner will be [rewarded](Glossary#reward) for the candidate. Miners therefore compete to see announcements before other miners, as this reduces [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost).

If we were to disperse miners with equal [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate) at equidistant points around the Earth they would experience the same average latency. Yet due to the financial benefit of reduced latency, they would tend to move closer to each other. This force is [pooling](Glossary#pooling) pressure, and manifests in several ways.

One manifestation is geographic, where independent miners become physically closer together. Another is cooperative, where formerly-independent miners join forces and co-locate grinding. Another is virtual, where miners become [grinders](Glossary#grinder) and aggregate hash rate to a single remote miner. Another is capital flow, since the higher hash rate associated with greater capital utilization is a form of co-location. Another is the existence of [relays](Glossary#relay), which have the [same effect](Relay-Fallacy) as hash rate aggregation.

The proximity-based pooling pressure is a consequence of the [chain](Glossary#sequence) sequence required by [consensus rules](Glossary#consensus-rules). **Bitcoin prescribes winner-take-all [transaction](Glossary#transaction) ordering, which produces disproportionate opportunity cost, and therefore pooling pressure.** The [variance discount](Variance-Discount-Flaw) is another pooling pressure caused by consensus.

The defense that Bitcoin *intends* to raise is market defense against anti-market forces. To do this it must distribute [hash power](Glossary#hash-power) broadly among [people](Glossary#person) so that it becomes difficult to [co-opt](Glossary#co-option). However pooling pressures inherent in the [consensus](Glossary#consensus) work against this objective. This is why the characteristic is termed a flaw.
