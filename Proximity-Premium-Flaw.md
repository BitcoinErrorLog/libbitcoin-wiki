[Latency](Glossary#latency) is the time required for [communication](Glossary#communication). Information moves at a speed not greater than the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light) and therefore latency cannot be eliminated. Different distances between [miners](Glossary#miners) implies [announcements](Glossary#announcement) will be known to some before others.

While a [miner](Glossary#miner) remains unaware of an announcement he wastes capital [grinding](Glossary#grind) on an [weak](Glossary#weak) [candidate](Glossary#candidate). As more time passes it becomes exponentially less likely that the miner will be [rewarded](Glossary#miner) by the candidate. Miners therefore compete to see announcements before other miners, as this reduces [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost).

If we were to disperse miners with equal [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate) at equidistant points around the Earth they would experience the same latency. Yet due to the financial benefit of reduced latency, they would tend to move closer to each other. This force is [pooling](Glossary#pooling) pressure, and manifests in several ways.

One manifestation of pooling pressure is geographic, where independent miners become physically closer together. Another is cooperative, where formerly-independent miners join forces and co-locate grinding. Another is virtual, where miners become [grinders](Glossary#grinder) and aggregate hash rate to a single remote miner. Another is capital flow, since higher hash rate is a form of co-location. Another is the existence of [relays](Glossary#relay), which have the [same effect](Relay-Fallacy) as hash rate aggregation.

The term "[selfish mining](Selfish-Mining-Fallacy)" refers to a pooling pressure created by [withholding](Glossary#withholding), though this also relates to latency. The financial benefit to improving cash flow by reducing [variance](Glossary#relay) is an aggregating pooling pressure. The [distortion](Glossary#distortion) and [variation](Glossary#variation) of [markets](Glossary#market) is a geopolitical pooling pressure.
