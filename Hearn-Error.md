There is a theory that [states](Glossary#state) cannot ban popular things.

This implies that high [transaction](Glossary#transaction) throughput allows effective defense against [attacks](Glossary#attack) and [coercion](Glossary#coercion). This in turn implies that Bitcoin can be secured by accepting the [centralizing](Glossary#centralization) force of very high transaction throughput.

The theory is invalid, as it demonstrably rests on a factual error. It is evident that states actually *prefer* to ban popular things. The following is a short list of commonly-banned nonviolent things:

* Drugs
* Gambling
* Prostitution
* Speech
* Assembly
* Trade
* Migration
* Weapons
* Labor
* Books
* Money
