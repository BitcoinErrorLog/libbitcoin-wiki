There is a theory that [states](Glossary#state) cannot ban popular things.

This implies that high [transaction](Glossary#transaction) throughput allows effective defense against [attacks](Glossary#attack) and [coercion](Glossary#coercion). This in turn implies that the only effective way to secure Bitcoin is to accept the [centralizing](Glossary#centralization) force of very high transaction throughput.

However, it is evident that states actually *prefer* to ban popular things (short list):

* Drugs
* Gambling
* Prostitution
* Speech
* Assembly
* Trade
* Migration
* Weapons
* Labor
* Money

The theory is invalid, as it resets on an obvious factual error.
