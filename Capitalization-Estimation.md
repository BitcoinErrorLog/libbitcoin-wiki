The potential [capitalization](Glossary#capitalization), and therefore potential [unit](Glossary#unit) [price](Glossary#price), of Bitcoin is estimated in various ways. A common approach is to imagine Bitcoin replacing [all state money](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/25/could-the-price-of-bitcoin-go-to-1-million.aspx) or even [gross world product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product). Other approaches that use [models of past price](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25) to predict future price are [economically irrational](Stock-to-Flow-Fallacy) and therefore not considered here.

Given that Bitcoin is money and not credit, the "money" approach is a more rational starting assumption. Yet without a clear understanding of the essential distinction between money and credit, this approach is often flawed in practice. As shown in [Credit Expansion Fallacy](Credit-Expansion-Fallacy), Bitcoin cannot limit credit expansion. If it eliminated credit expansion (hypothetically), there would be no production whatsoever and it would be worth nothing. The most rational starting assumption regarding credit expansion, is that Bitcoin is reserved at the same rate as other monies. The rate of credit expansion is driven by human [time preference](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Time-Preference-Fallacy) alone, so this is an assumption that production is therefore consistent with historical norms.

Let us consider four possible definitions for the "money" to replace:

* Tangible money.
* Base money (M0).
* Bank credit (M3-M1).
* All credit (bank, debt, equity).
* Gross product.

Using tangible money ("vault cash") only is an irrational approach. The money that is accounted for as money equivalent must also be included if one is to consider tangible money, since they are of the same supply. [Central banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank) print and coin tangible money when required, against a base of "obligations" to do so, and all credit in the money is expanded against this base. This concept is discussed in [State Banking Principle](State-Banking-Principle). Using credit is also an irrational approach, since Bitcoin is not credit. As a money it is used to [settle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(finance)) credit obligations. This concept is discussed in [Debt Loop Fallacy](Debt-Loop-Fallacy). So of course using any combination of money and credit (such as [M1, M2 or M3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#United_States), as these include M0) is irrational by the same reasoning. Gross product is similarly unjustifiable for substitution as it is neither money nor credit.

However, for the sake of comparison, let us estimate each of the five options listed above. Base values for the following table are U.S. Dollar amounts borrowed from [State Banking Principle](State-Banking-Principle). These are expanded by an estimate of [relative size](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4202768-u-s-percent-world-stock-market-cap-tops-40-percent) of the the world economy by equity market capitalization. The U.S. market is approximately 40% of global markets. Therefore these values exceed U.S. numbers by a factor of 1/40%. This favors simplicity over precision, as the only objective is to demonstrate a rational method of estimation. The amount of Bitcoin assumed is 18,952,500 given 95% mined (~10 years future) and 5% lost (e.g. Satoshi lost private keys).

| Tangible money   |   $4,347,460,000,000 |       $229,387 |
