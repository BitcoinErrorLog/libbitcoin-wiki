Miners play a [zero sum game](Zero-Sum-Property) within a [positive sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win-win_game) [economy](Glossary#economy).

As the [utility](Glossary#utility) of Bitcoin to [people](Glossary#person) increases, both the [fee](Glossary#fee) level and [exchange](Glossary#exchange) [price](Glossary#price) necessarily increase. These increases both contribute to [reward](Glossary#reward) utility. However utility is not unbounded, it is decreased by rising fees and always limited by [substitutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good). [Exchange](Glossary#exchange) rates are a measure of utility, including the [capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value) of expectations.

Initially rising utility creates a higher [rate of return](Glossary#interest) on capital [investment](Glossary#invest) in [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate). This creates an [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) for not capturing the outsized return. This causes an increase in hash rate from existing and/or new [miners](Glossary#miner). The increase is eventually captured in a [difficulty](Glossary#difficulty) [adjustment](Glossary#adjustment), returning average rate of return to [market](Glossary#market) levels.

It has been argued that [blocks](Glossary#block) mined in a period of rising price results in outsized returns to miners until the adjustment. This fails to understand the nature of capital investment. Investors do not invest in past returns, they invest in future returns. These returns are *always* speculative. In other words, there is no reason to assume that this speculation is any more or less effective in Bitcoin mining than any other endeavor.
