Miners play a [zero sum game](Zero-Sum-Property) within a [positive sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win-win_game) [economy](Glossary#economy).

As the [utility](Glossary#utility) of Bitcoin to [people](Glossary#person) increases, both the [fee](Glossary#fee) level and [exchange](Glossary#exchange) [price](Glossary#price) necessarily increase. These increases both contribute to [reward](Glossary#reward) utility. However utility is not unbounded, it is decreased by rising fees and always limited by [substitutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_good). [Exchange](Glossary#exchange) rates are a measure of utility, including the [capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_value) of expectations.

Initially rising utility creates a higher [rate of return](Glossary#interest) on capital [investment](Glossary#invest) in [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate). This creates an [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) for not capturing the outsized return. This causes an increase in hash rate from existing and/or new [miners](Glossary#miner). The increase is eventually captured in a [difficulty](Glossary#difficulty) [adjustment](Glossary#adjustment), returning average rate of return to [market](Glossary#market) levels.

It has been argued that [blocks](Glossary#block) mined in a period of rising price actually produce outsized returns for miners, at least until the adjustment. This fails to understand the nature of capital investment. Investors do not invest in past returns, they invest in future returns. Investments dependent on price changes are always [speculative](Glossary#speculation). In other words, there is no reason to assume that Bitcoin *speculation* is any more or less effective than any other. Bitcoin mining *investment* on the other hand is based on the predictable relationship between price, hash rate, difficulty, competition over time. That relationship predicts that the average of all mining approaches the market rate of interest over time. Shorter time periods are unpredictable and longer timer periods predict market returns.
