TLDR:

Censorship resistance in Bitcoin depends on transaction fees. If a majority miner tries to censor, rising fees on unconfirmed transactions create incentives for non-censoring miners to confirm them for profit. This competition can eventually outpace the censor's hash power.

Only a state, able to leverage taxes, can afford sustained censorship, needing to subsidize mining beyond the fee premium. Without integrated fees, censorship would succeed, or a secondary fee market would emerge.

Ultimately, there's no guarantee fees will always counter a censor, nor that a censor can maintain subsidies indefinitely. This uncertainty makes resistance to state control an unproven axiomâ€”a core assumption underpinning Bitcoin.

--------

Resistance to [censorship](Glossary#censorship) is a consequence of [transaction](Glossary#transaction) [fees](Glossary#fee). Censorship enforcement is indistinguishable from [soft fork](Glossary#soft-fork) enforcement, with [majority hash power](Glossary#majority-hash-power) rejecting non-censoring [blocks](Glossary#block). Without such enforcement transactions are [confirmed](Glossary#confirmation) on an economically-rational basis despite individual [miner](Glossary#miner) subjectivity.

A majority miner is financially profitable. As such there is no cost to acquiring the means of censorship. As mining is necessarily an [anonymous](Risk-Sharing-Principle) role it is always possible for any actor to acquire and deploy majority hash power, and to control it at any given time. As shown in [Proof of Work Fallacy](Proof-of-Work-Fallacy), [hard forks](Glossary#hard-fork) cannot be used to selectively evict the censor and instead accelerate [coin](Glossary#coin) collapse.

In the case of active censorship, fees may rise on transactions that fail to confirm. This fee premium creates a greater potential profit for miners who confirm censored transactions. At a sufficient level this opportunity produces additional competition and therefore increasing overall [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate).

If rising non-censoring [hash power](Glossary#hash-power) exceeds that of the censor, its enforcement fails. The censor is thus faced with the choice of subsidizing operations or abandoning the effort. Only the [state](Glossary#state) can perpetually subsidize operations, as it can compel tax and gains from preservation of its own currency regime. **The state must consume taxes to at least the level of the fee premium to maintain censorship enforcement.**

A coin without integrated fees would either fail to a censor or evolve a side fee market. As shown in [Side Fee Fallacy](Side-Fee-Fallacy) it is not necessary that fees be integrated, however fee integration is an important anonymity technique. In either case censorship resistance arises only from the fee premium. The [subsidy](Glossary#subsidy) portion of the block [reward](Glossary#reward) does not contribute to censorship resistance because the censor earns the same subsidy as other miners.

It is possible that censorship enforcement could result in a [price](Glossary#price) collapse, causing the censor to incur a loss on operations. However in this case its objective has been achieved, with no opportunity for the [economy](Glossary#economy) to counter the censor. This collapse might be achieved at negligible cost by simply demonstrating the intent to censor. It is also possible that a censorship soft fork could lead to a price increase, as white market business embraces the associated state approval. Nevertheless, for the coin to survive, its economy must continue to generate a fee premium sufficient to overpower the censor.

It cannot be shown that the economy will generate sufficient fees to overpower a censor. Similarly, it cannot be shown that a censor will be willing and able to subsidize operations at any given level. It is therefore not possible to prove censorship resistance. This is why resistance to state control is [axiomatic](Axiom-of-Resistance).
