See the “Cryptoeconomics” side menu for a full list of topics.

This started as a way to avoid retyping the same ideas, 140 characters at a time. In keeping with that environment, topics were as short as possible, and informal. I did not intend to write a book, and still could not.

Most of the topics (including this one) were written on my phone, on a flight, train or in a coffee shop. Many are quick observations that arise from intimate knowledge of core Bitcoin code or long self-study and experience in various disciplines.

Over time topics began to interact, a necessary taxonomy erupted, and what had been a casual process of ad-hoc observation started to become work. I made an honest effort to rationalize links and terminology, but my focus remains on understanding.

I have used the terms [Catallactics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics) and [Praxeology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxeology) to describe the underlying discipline. People also use the term [Austrian Economics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School). I find each of these unsatisfying, so have started to refer to the discipline as “Rational Economics”. A strictly rational person with some perspective on economics would understand the inevitability of this.

The topics form a graph, over which no total ordering seems appropriate. The table of contents is a poorly-imposed order. While some attempt at progression has been made, I recommend reading the topics as they were written, as a curiosity.
