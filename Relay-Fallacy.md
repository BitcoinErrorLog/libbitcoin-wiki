The [peer-to-peer](Glossary#peer-to-peer) network disseminates [blocks](Glossary#block) and [unconfirmed](Glossary#unconfirmed) [transactions](Glossary#transaction). The [protocol](Glossary#protocol) itself allows [nodes](Glossary#node) to protect against [denial of service](Glossary#denial-of-service). Consequently this [communication](Glossary#communication) requires no [identity](Glossary#identity). This protection is how the network avoids the need for permission to participate.

However this protection comes at a cost in terms of [announcement](Glossary#announcement) [latency](Glossary#latency), and because of the [Proximity Premium Flaw](Proximity-Premium-Flaw), lower latency translates into higher [apparent hash power](Glossary#apparent-hash-power). Therefore [miners](Glossary#miner) compete for reduced latency. One way to reduce latency is [pooling](Glossary#pooling), another is to use a more efficient dissemination mechanism. Given that pooling surrenders [power](Glossary#power) to the operator, presumably the latter option is preferable.

One way to reduce latency is [optimization](Glossary#optimization) of the peer-to-peer network. Work in this area has dramatically reduced latency. This reduction benefits lower [hash power](Glossary#hash-power) miners disproportionately because other miners see more blocks (their own) before announcement. This has the effect of reducing pooling pressure.

The other approach is to join a distinct network, called a [relay](Glossary#relay), that has lower latency due to elimination of denial-of-service protections. The relay accepts [communication](Glossary#communication) from a set of miners, over the peer-to-peer (or other) protocol. The relay consists of a set of [machines](Glossary#machine) under the control of the [relayer](Glossary#relayer). It communicates the announcements within its internal network and eventually to the joined miners.

The important security observation is that communication within the relay is under the relayer's control. The relayer can delay certain blocks based on miner, region, [signal](Glossary#signal), non-payment, etc. A relayer sells reduced latency, and is therefore is in the mining business. From a security standpoint it matters not if this service is offered for free. Miners may as well offer [grinders](Glossary#grinder) free reduced latency and [variance](Glossary#variance).

Relays are aggregations of miners and miners are aggregations of grinders. The greater the hash power aggregation, the more profitable is the mine, as is the relay. One may consider that grinders are free to leave mines and mines are free to leave relays. It is of course possible for a grinder to run his own mine and his own relay. The point that is often lost in this analysis is that larger aggregations are more profitable. So leaving the largest relay increases relative cost, just as leaving the largest mine.

A theory behind relays is that they reduce pooling pressure. This is a fallacy as it is clear that any pooling reduction caused by a relay does not disappear but is *transferred* to the relay itself. Relay statistics are never presented with pooling statistics, masking the transfer. However peer-to-peer optimizations can be *actual* reductions in pooling pressure, since the originating miner remains in control of his announcement and cannot exclude others.
