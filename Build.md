Libbitcoin provides a simple installer for building from sources on **Linux** and **OSX** as well as Visual Studio projects for **Windows**. Sources can also be built manually using Autotools.

Please see build instructions in the [README](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin/blob/version2/README.md) file.
