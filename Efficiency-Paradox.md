TLDR:

The idea that selling units from one side of a split coin for units of the other diminishes the coin's utility is incorrect. Each transaction involves both a buyer and a seller, keeping balance intact.

Bitcoin mining efficiency cannot increase in terms of real cost since all costs ultimately resolve to energy. Technological improvements do not change that transaction confirmation cost always equals the reward. Increased hash rate leads to adjusted difficulty, ensuring costs align with the reward.

Exchanging units isn’t "dumping"—dumping requires subsidies. Reduced hoarding doesn’t always lower prices; it depends on buyer behavior.

Bitcoin [mining](Glossary#mine) overall cannot be made more efficient in terms of real cost. Given that all costs resolve to energy, this could be restated as, Bitcoin cannot be made more energy efficient. [Paradoxically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox), no matter what technology improvement is introduced, the cost of [transaction](Glossary#transaction) [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) remains the sum of the [reward](Glossary#reward) for confirmation.

**This apparent contradiction arises from the fact that reward ultimately determines cost.** An increase in [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate) for the same cost results in a [difficulty](Glossary#difficulty) increase to maintain the [block](Glossary#block) [period](Glossary#period), increasing cost accordingly. Bitcoin mining must always consume in cost the amount of its current reward.
