Bitcoin [consensus rules](Glossary#consensus-rules) create a perfectly predictable rate of [monetary inflation](Glossary#inflation). There is a theory that this causes a reduction in [purchasing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power) (i.e. [price inflation](Glossary#price-inflation)). This theory fails to account for the predictability of Bitcoin inflation and is consequently invalid.
