Bitcoin [consensus rules](Glossary#consensus-rules) create a period of [monetary inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation). There is a theory that this causes the money to lose [purchasing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power). As shown in [Inflation Principle](Inflation-Principle), **no change in purchasing power is implied by an increase in supply** of a [market money](Money-Taxonomy). The theory is therefore invalid.
