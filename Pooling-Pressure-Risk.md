[Pooling](Glossary#pooling) pressure is the set of [economic](Glossary#economic) incentives for [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate) aggregation, specifically:

* [Proximity Premium](Proximity-Premium-Flaw)
* [Variance Discount](Variance-Discount-Flaw)
* [Distortion](Glossary#distortion)
* [Variation](Glossary#variation)

There are several manifestations of of pooling. One is geographic, where independent [miners](Glossary#miner) become physically closer together. Another is cooperative, where formerly-independent miners join forces and co-locate [grinding](Glossary#grinding). Another is virtual, where miners become grinders and aggregate hash rate to a single remote miner. Another is the existence of [relays](Glossary#relays), which [aggregate miner hash power](Relay-Fallacy). Another is capital flow, since the higher hash rate associated with greater capital utilization is a form of co-location. 

Given a perpetual positive pressure, [transaction](Glossary#transaction) selection will eventually be reduced to one person's control. It is possible that this is already the case. The risk to Bitcoin is that one person is the [sole defense](Risk-Sharing-Principle) of [utility](Glossary#utility), making [co-option](Glossary#co-option) all but certain.
