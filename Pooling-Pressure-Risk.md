[Pooling](Glossary#pooling) pressure is the set of financial incentives for [hash rate](Glossary#hash-rate) aggregation, specifically:

* [Proximity Premium](Proximity-Premium-Flaw)
* [Variance Discount](Variance-Discount-Flaw)
* [Market Variation](Glossary#variation)
* [Market Distortion](Glossary#distortion)

While [latency](Glossary#latency) and [variance](Glossary#variance) are unavoidable, [consensus rules](Glossary#consensus-rules) actually *create* the first two financial incentives. Variation is a consequence of varying [market](Glossary#market) price for [mining](Glossary#mine) resources. Distortion is a consequence of varying non-market costs including tax, regulation, subsidy, and patent; the force that Bitcoin is [intended to resist](Axiom-of-Resistance).

There are several manifestations of of pooling. One is geographic, where independent [miners](Glossary#miner) become physically closer together. Another is cooperative, where formerly-independent miners join forces and co-locate [grinding](Glossary#grind). Another is virtual, where miners become [grinders](Glossary#grinder) and aggregate hash rate to a single remote miner. Another is the existence of [relays](Glossary#relay), which [aggregate miner hash power](Relay-Fallacy). Another is capital flow, since the higher hash rate associated with greater capital utilization is a form of co-location. 

**Given a perpetual positive pressure, [transaction](Glossary#transaction) selection will eventually be reduced to one [person's](Glossary#person) control.** It is possible that this is already the case. The risk to Bitcoin is that one person is the [sole defense](Risk-Sharing-Principle) of [utility](Glossary#utility), making successful [co-option](Glossary#co-option) inevitable. This risk [cannot be mitigated](Balance-of-Power-Fallacy) by the [economy](Glossary#economy).
