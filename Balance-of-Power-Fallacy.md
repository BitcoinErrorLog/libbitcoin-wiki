Power in Bitcoin rests with [miners](Glossary#miner) and [merchants](Glossary#merchant) (users). Yet these two powers are not "balanced" between each other, as if locked in some sort of [checks-and-balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers#Checks_and_balances) system. Miner power is [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality) to merchant power. Miners control [transaction](Glossary#transaction) selection and merchants control [validity](Glossary#validity). Validity cannot control transaction selection (miners will **always** have this power), and miners cannot control validity (though if they are seemingly economically irrational, like a [state](Glossary#state), they can indefinitely prevent [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation)).

The balance of powers in Bitcoin is between [individuals](Glossary#person) and the state. Individuals can be miners and can be merchants. With broad distribution of these activities it becomes difficult for state actors to [disrupt](Glossary#attack) or [subvert](Glossary#coercion) the [money](Glossary#coin). The idea that miners and merchants are in an adversarial position is a failure to understand the Bitcoin security model. These two powers cannot control each other, and the system is not designed for them to do so. Even [states create systems that attempt to isolate their monies from control by the state itself](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm), Bitcoin is no different in that sense.

Merchants purchase a service from miners and as such the two are engaged in [trade](Glossary#trade). Merchants purchase mining services that meet their [rules](Glossary#consensus-rules) for a satisfactory [fee](Glossary#fee). They are free to [split](Glossary#split) and miners are free to not mine at all, or to not select particular transactions for whatever [reason](Glossary#censorship) suits them. Trade is not adversarial, it is voluntary and mutually-beneficial.

This failure in understanding leads people to believe that mining can be centrally [pooled](Glossary#pooled) as long as merchants are not [centralized](Glossary#centralization) in validation, as the [economy](Glossary#economy) can control the behavior of mining, rendering the system secure. This belief is incorrect but unfortunately people are drawing this invalid conclusion from recent events. A closely-related fallacy is the belief that a [proof-of-work](Glossary#proof) change by merchants can control miner behavior.
