[Power](Glossary#power) in Bitcoin rests with [miners](Glossary#miner) and [merchants](Glossary#merchant). Yet these two powers are not "balanced" between each other, as if locked in some sort of [checks-and-balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers#Checks_and_balances) system. Miner power is [orthogonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality) to merchant power. Miners control [transaction](Glossary#transaction) selection and merchants control [validity](Glossary#validity), and neither can control the other.

The balance of powers in Bitcoin is between [individuals](Glossary#person) and the [state](Glossary#state). Individuals can be miners and can be merchants. With broad distribution of these activities it becomes difficult for state actors to [disrupt](Glossary#attack) or [subvert](Glossary#coercion) the [money](Glossary#coin). Even states create systems that [attempt](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm) to isolate their moneys from [political](Glossary#political) control. Bitcoin is no different in that sense.

The idea that miners and merchants are in an adversarial position is a failure to understand the Bitcoin security model. Merchants purchase a service from miners and as such the two are engaged in [trade](Glossary#trade). Merchants purchase mining services that meet their [rules](Glossary#consensus-rules) for a satisfactory [fee](Glossary#fee). They are free to [split](Glossary#split) and miners are free to not mine at all, or to not select particular transactions for whatever [reason](Glossary#censorship) suits them. Trade is neither adversarial nor asymmetrical, it is voluntary and mutually-beneficial.

This failure in understanding leads people to believe that mining can be centrally [pooled](Glossary#pooling) as long as merchants are not [centralized](Glossary#centralization) in validation, as the [economy](Glossary#economy) can control the behavior of mining, rendering the system secure. This belief is incorrect but unfortunately people are [drawing this invalid conclusion](https://www.coindesk.com/uasf-revisited-will-bitcoins-user-revolt-leave-lasting-legacy) from recent events. A [closely-related fallacy](Proof-of-Work-Fallacy) is the belief that a [proof-of-work](Glossary#proof) [fork](Glossary#fork) by merchants can control miner behavior.
