[Time preference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference) is the [Catallactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catallactics) assumption of human preference for present goods over future goods. The economic rate of interest is the direct reflection of time preference. It will be shown that this preference is also reflected in the reserve ratio. In other words, the rate of capital reserve against credit is the interest rate.

> The level of the pure rate of interest is determined by the market for the exchange of present goods against future goods, a market which we shall see permeates many parts of the economic system... Thus, if, on the time market, 100 ounces of gold exchange for the prospect of obtaining 105 ounces of gold one year from now, then the rate of interest is approximately 5 percent per annum. This is the time-discount rate of future to present money... The pure rate of interest will then be the going rate of time discount, the ratio of the price of present goods to that of future goods.

> Rothbard: [Man Economy and State](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market/html/p/989)

Rothbard's last statement is not literally accurate, as a discount rate is not the same as a ratio. Note that a present good is priced higher than a future good, so in the example 100oz of gold (present good) trades for 105oz delivered in the future (future good).

Interest rate as discount rate:
```
present-goods-price = future-goods-price * (1 + interest-rate)
interest-rate = present-goods-price / future-goods-price - 1 
interest-rate = 105oz / 100oz - 1 = 5%
```
Interest rate as price ratio:
```
interest-rate = present-goods-price / future-goods-price
interest-rate = 105oz / 100oz = 105%
```
As shown in [Depreciation Principle](Depreciation-Principle), no actual consumption occurs in the trade of a product from producer and consumer. A product is only consumed to the extent that it depreciates. This is evident in the fact that a product can be resold at present price, recovering the portion not depreciated. Similarly, any remaining portion can be consumed in the future, offsetting the present price of purchasing more of the same. So consumption is the depreciated fraction of the original hoard. Using the ratio for depreciation obtains:
```
depreciation-rate = unconsumed-goods-price / hoarded-goods-price
```
Given that all prices are represented in the same money, `goods-price` can be dropped from both relations with the understanding that each name represents the money price of the amount of the good.
```
interest-rate = present / future
depreciation-rate = unconsumed / hoarded
```
Considering that `future-goods` is invested capital and that `unconsumed-goods` are present goods obtains:
```
interest-rate = present / invested
depreciation-rate = present / hoarded
```
Substituting and rearranging obtains:
```
interest-rate = (hoarded * depreciation-rate) / investment
interest-rate = (hoarded / invested) * depreciation-rate
```
Given that all prices are money prices we can consider the effect of [liquidating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation) the hoard at any time. Money does not depreciate as do goods. A *pure* money depreciates only by the [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) of not investing it. This cost is measured in interest, which is the time preference for [economic goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods). Money is not a good, it represents the opportunity to trade for a good. As such its depreciation is determined by the preference for goods.

Time preference is interest and therefore interest cannot determine time preference. If one erroneously includes the opportunity cost of money as depreciation in determination of interest, the **irrational result** is that hoarded and invested goods are always in the same amount.
```
money-interest-rate = (hoarded / invested) * money-interest-rate
hoarded = invested
```
However in the case of *actual* money the sum of [demurrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage) and [seigniorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) is the depreciation rate. Notice that depreciation only affects the hoard as investment represents future goods, which do not depreciate until they become present goods.
```
money-interest-rate = (hoarded / invested) * money-depreciation-rate
```
Therefore, in the theoretical case of a pure money, we can see that the interest rate is the ratio of hoarded to invested capital.
```
interest-rate = hoarded / invested
```
Notice that this is the savings relation, between [consumption and investment](Speculative-Consumption). This ratio of hoard to investment is the fraction of each person's reserve in the context of [fractional reserve](Full-Reserve-Fallacy) lending. Its inverse is the money multiplier implied by [credit expansion](Credit-Expansion-Fallacy). It is also the interest rate. All of these are different observations of time preference.
