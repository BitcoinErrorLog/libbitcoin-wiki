There is a theory that the [price inflation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) caused by [seigniorage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) causes the production of lower “quality” and/or less [durable](Depreciation-Principle) goods. **The theory necessarily presumes that value is objective and therefore contradicts the [subjective theory of value](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value).** Durability is one of many qualities that a [person](Glossary#person) might [value](Glossary#value) in one good over another. As such the theory is invalid.

There is no provable relation between the number of [units](Glossary#unit) of [money](Money-Taxonomy) required to trade for a good and the qualities of a good that one might prefer. Greater *wealth* (which is perception, as value is subjective), implies lower [time preference](Time-Preference-Fallacy), as implied by the [theory of marginal utility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility). However ever under the assumption of a misperception of increasing wealth, lower time preference does not imply a preference for lower “quality” goods. It implies only an increasing willingness to [lend](Glossary#lend) a greater portion of one’s capital.

[Rothbard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard) makes this unfortunate error in “[What Has Government Done to Our Money](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Has_Government_Done_to_Our_Money%3F)” and it continues to be perpetuated.

> The quality of work will decline in an inflation for a more subtle reason: people become enamored of "get-rich-quick" schemes, seemingly within their grasp in an era of ever-rising prices, and often scorn sober effort.

It is assumed, certainly by Rothbard, that people *always* prefer to get rich sooner than later, as implied by the axiom of time preference. And as shown by the [Fisher Hypothesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_hypothesis), to the extent that inflation is predictable it is offset in the [real interest rate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_interest_rate). To the extent it is not predictable Rothbard’s conjecture does not apply.
