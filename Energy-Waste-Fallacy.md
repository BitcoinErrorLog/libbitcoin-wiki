There is a theory that [proof-of-work](Glossary#proof) (PoW) wastes energy. This implies that the level of security provided is greater than necessary or the same level of security can be provided by another externalized proof at a lower energy cost. An internalized proof, specifically [proof-of-stake](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) (PoS), is an entirely different security model which is not considered here.

Total [hash power](Glossary#hash-power) is a function of [reward](Glossary#reward), which is a function of [fees](Glossary#fee), which are determined by the [confirmation](Glossary#confirmation) [market](Glossary#market). If a [person](Glossary#person) considers current hash power insufficient to secure [trade](Glossary#trade) at a given [value](Glossary#value) against [double spend](Glossary#double-spend) then the [depth](Glossary#depth) requirement increases. Additionally, as shown in [Utility Threshold Property](Utility-Threshold-Property), [transactions](Glossary#transaction) with insufficient value for even single confirmation security are [priced](Glossary#price) out of the [chain](Glossary#chain).

These upper and lower security bounds depend on confirmation cost and are therefore independent of the proof technique. **There is no *necessary* level of security, just a subjective confirmation depth and minimum utility.**

Confirmation security increases with the cost of generating each [block](Glossary#block). The double spend of a transaction requires that its [branch](Glossary#branch) be superseded by another with a probabilistically greater cost. So the only way energy cost can be reduced is by expending the same average per-block cost with a lower energy component.

PoW incurs cost in several forms, including labor, hardware, services, land, etc. Any other externalized proof consumes these same resources, though potentially in different proportion. The question of energy cost reduction is therefore reduced to whether an energy component of the cost of a proof can be replaced by an other resource component with the same cost.

Unless one can show that the substituted resources can be produced and maintained at a life-cycle energy cost at least below their acquisition cost, there is no energy savings in the substitution. In other words, it must be be shown that the development and coordination of all necessary raw materials, intermediate components, final assembly, shipment, deployment, operation, and retirement of a 1 Terabyte drive can be accomplished with lower total energy consumption (i.e. life-cycle energy cost) than the amount of energy required to obtain and utilize the drive (i.e. miner financial cost). The theory is invalid without such proof.

In December 2017 the estimated annualized cost of energy consumed in Bitcoin mining was $1,628,000,000, based on the approximations of 32.56 terawatt hours consumed at an average $.05 per kilowatt hour energy cost. At the same time this cost level equates to the consumption of 32,560,000 terabyte drives at an average price of $50 per drive.
